I had the surgery and everything went fine i was home 4 days later sore but recovering. then 2 weeks into my post opt i started running a fever it started a 99.5 and as a week went on it got up to 103. 2 trips to the emergency later and i was back in the hospital. I had got an extremely bad infection behind my incision. They had to reopen my incision all the way to remove the infection while I was awake might I add and they started pumping me with IV antibiotics. I has a horrible reaction to the meds and my kidneys started shutting down i had less than 50% function of then for over a week. This is what has the going on in a nut shell. I have been in the hospital 13 days now but I am doing So much better. I am off all IV meds and my kidneys are almost back to normal. my incision is healing good too they feel like they have gotten all the infection and I will have a wound vac for about a month that will help with the healing. Thank you all so much for your prayers and support this is by far the hardest thing I have ever been through and I hate seeing Ben so worried and have to go through it too. I know that I am too weak to do this myself but I am clinging to the word of God and by His grace he is getting us through. I know he is carrying me through and I am on my way to going home.

Nancy's Homegoing Celebration will be 2:00 PM Sunday January 22. Both will be at Hillier Funeral Home in College Station 4080 Highway 6 S. Thank you for the wonderful ways you have blessed and helped Nancy through her last 14 months here on earth. + Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by Stephen McDaniel 13 months ago Share Nancy's Homegoing: At 10:45 last night (Wednesday) my sweet wife Nancy got to meet Jesus as well as again see her mom step-mom dad and brother. She has had very labored breathing for awhile and her body was exhausted. I was by her bed at Hospice Brazos Valley holding her hand playing her favorite songs from her iPhone. Toward the beginning of The Hallelujah Chorus she took her last breath. So she went from listening to singing in an instant. Our son Brian had been up helping out for the last three days. Our daughter Sarah was at the Hospice facility at the time. We miss her so much. Thank all of you who have cared about her loved her and helped us prayerfully and financially through this time. We are so thankful that because of Jesus we will see her again.+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Stephen McDaniel 13 months ago Share Nancy has had more difficulty breathing so it was decided this afternoon that it would be best to admit her to the in-patient Hospice Brazos Valley facility in Bryan. They gave her heavy dosses of morphine and a strong sedative that has her sound asleep now and her breathing much less labored. We are hopeful the situation will improve in the next couple of days and we can go back home. We appreciate your prayers.+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Stephen McDaniel 14 months ago Share 11 Over the past couple of weeks Nancy has had a problem with fluid buildup in her abdomen caused by the cancer there. This has increased the size of her abdomen causing a lot of pressure on her diaphragm and making breathing even more difficult. So yesterday we went to the A&M Physician Center and Dr. McClelland drained 1.2 Liters of fluid from her abdomen. It's made her feel a little more comfortable although there's still fluid there and he said she'll probably need to continue having it drained from time to time. Yesterday was the first time Nancy's left the house in over a month. We were able to take portable oxygen tanks and keep her hooked up to oxygen the whole time. She doesn't have much appetite and stays in the recliner in my study almost all the time. It helps her breathing to be sitting up. She's also taking somewhat higher doses of morphine which helps her breathing. Mentally she's still as sharp as ever. Please continue praying for her. We're still praying for healing.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

It hasnt been till this last chemo cycle that she started to need to rest more and more often and the week following each chemo is a real drain on her physical and mental reserves. In addition the treatment causes horendous mouth sores making it difficult to eat.Through this she amazingly goes camping walks through the Alaska state fair and is still physically threatening enough to her new husband Dan that he pretty much does what she wants. Of course it helps that he loves her so much that he never notices the threats and laughs away. She doesnt wear a hat or a scarf and looks beautiful as she trys to figure out how to put on \"\"decal eyebrows\"\".Today however is \"\"crux\"\" day. We wait for the results of her PET scan to see how we have done after 6 cycles of chemo. We are hoping to have destroyed bthe chest tumor completely as well as the lung effected. If the results are great as expected we can move on to the next treatment level with even more hope of success.Thank you all so much! We have heard fro USAF SERE groups the US Coast Guard rescue swimmer on Kodiak the police in Baltimore. We have best wishes from Everest Doctors and world adventures like Vern Tejas who himself survived cancer. We have SO MANY FRIENDS Its hard to believe and its overwelming.Keep praying and posting and sending good Kharma.Brian Horner+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 6 Posted by Stephanie Peel 8 months ago Share 11 Shannon is at peace. She no longer has pain. She fought so very hard to stay here but we have no doubt she was welcomed to Heaven by her father Ken whom she loved and missed dearly. Please do allow her family some time as they come to terms with her loss. Information regarding services for Shannon will be shared once the arrangements are in place. As many of you understand too well Shannon's fight with cancer was exhausting not only physically and emotionally but also financially. In lieu of flowers we ask that you consider a donation to Chris Ryan and Halle. Thank you all for your prayers and support. Shannon was (is) well-loved and she knew it.+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Stephanie Peel 12 months ago Share ***UPDATE 2/23/17***We need your help. The Goggins family is in need of financial support right now.As you likely know Shannon has been diagnosed with stage 4 mucinous cervical adenocarcinoma (an uncommon subtype of cervical cancer) with METS to the peritoneal cavity. In May of 2016 Shannon underwent an abdominal laparotomy in which the following was removed: omentum spleen gallbladder 2 feet of bowel a small portion of her liver and a portion of her diaphragm. During surgery she was treated with a chemo-bath IPHC (heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy) and an ileostomy was placed to reroute the bowels. The ileostomy came with many issues from diet restriction and lack of nutrients to large decreases in weight. Her surgeon wanted her to start chemo and radiation 6-8 weeks following surgery. Unfortunately Shannon was too weak to start the chemo at that time. In July of 2016 she underwent 25 treatments of radiation to a localized pelvic tumor. In August 2016 Shannon's first set of scans and blood work showed no evidence of disease but this was short lived. In November 2016 Shannon's cancer markers were once again elevated and a repeat CT scan showed new cancerous activity in the peritoneal cavity near the liver bladder kidneys and pelvis. She then had outpatient surgery for stents to be placed in both ureters (tubes that drain from kidneys to bladder) as the pain was again out of control and labs were showing decreased kidney function. In mid January the stents were blocked and were replaced with larger ones which are still causing a great deal of pain as they are also pushing on a growing tumor.Shannon's current prognosis is not great. Several weeks ago she saw her oncologist for a follow up. One of her pelvic tumors that has been felt upon exam had already grown since December. The oncologist strongly advised Shannon to try traditional I.V. chemo for cervical cancer right away as the cancer is now said to be in the advanced stages and traditional chemo has not been done throughout this entire journey. She was informed that the goal of this chemo is merely to decrease the size of the tumor to aid in pain management and would not buy her much time but could lessen her time if she chose not to follow through. Shannon had her first round of chemo a couple weeks ago. It was pretty rough on her as she instantly lost 6 pounds which at this point she cannot afford to lose. Shannon is very frail at just over 100 pounds still quite painful and has zero endurance; however that girl has FIGHT and wants to BEAT this more than you know!!We recently asked for input and referrals/contacts to help us get Shannon into a treatment program that can help her. You all really came through - we had hundreds of responses! As a result Shannon has an appointment at MD Anderson in Texas on March 2nd! We are thrilled that she will be travelling to a facility that may be able to offer new treatment options and renewed hope.Shannon faces many expenses as she fights this cancer. Travel hotel copays multiple prescriptions and medical supplies add up incredibly quickly. These costs can easily become overwhelming. If you are able please bless the Goggins family with a financial gift to help Shannon continue her fight. Please pray for new effective treatments. Please continue to pray for the doctors’ wisdom and Shannon’s healing. Your support is so needed and so appreciated! Please SHARE!+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Stephanie Peel 20 months ago Share 11 Hello everyone! First a quick update - Shannon is healing but she is still having ongoing issues with dehydration due to her abdominal surgery. This has led to more hospital stays unfortunately. She is working with her doctors to try to remedy this situation but it is proving to be very challenging. Please continue to pray that these issues will be overcome as her day-today energy and pain levels are directly related to her ability to stay properly hydrated. Now for the fun stuff - there will be a charity golf outing for Shannon at Arrowhead golf course on July 31st at 10:00am! We need teams of 4 for the scramble! The cost is $220/team with a $55 deposit required. Food is included! We will also have a silent auction and 50/50 raffle so even if golf isn't your thing please come and eat ($15) and enjoy the afternoon with us! Please direct inquiries to cancersucksforshannon@gmail.com. We would also love to hear from you if you are interested in sponsoring a hole donating something for the silent auction or making a side dish for the BBQ. We are happy to answer any questions you may have so please don't hesitate to email us! Thank you all for your continued support!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Stephanie Peel 21 months ago Share 11 Unfortunately Shannon was readmitted to the hospital late Wednesday night due to pain and dehydration. She was transferred to Mary Free Bed on Friday. She will likely remain there for several days. The goals right now are for her to get strong enough for radiation and chemotherapy and to go back home to be with her kids and husband.

We were hoping for no chemo but it\\'s not an option given the rarity and little research they have on this type of cancer. BUT they have a plan. Dad will go next week for the echocardiogram and to have a port put in. The Monday after Thanksgiving he will be admitted into UT Hospital for the week where they will monitor him closely and do 4 straight 8 hour days of a \"\"slow push\"\". They say it is a complicated cocktail and treatment so it will be best for him to be there the whole time rather than coming home in the evenings and traveling back in the mornings. He will do this four times with a 3 week break in between each 4 day rounds. Please pray against any complications and that they will not have to prolong the treatments beyond the 4 months. UT Oncology has been great to fight the VA for Dad so we are not having to do it! They have been a blessing. YOU ALL have been a blessing with all the love and prayer support.

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Jessie Gray 11 months ago Share Hi everyoneI wanted to update everyone about Sarahs fight against cancer. Sarah has written an update that I am going to relay to everyone. But first I just want to praise Sarah for all she has accomplished with her battle and how proud I am of her!! I Love you bunches xoxo Here is Sarahs letter to you all: Hi everyone I appologize it's taken me so long but I wanted to update everyone. It's hard to believe but I am less than a couple weeks away from my 43rd Birthday. This will be a year since I found out I had a tumor in my lung. I started treatment last June and I am still receiving treatment every 3 weeks. It took me a bit more than a month to figure out where I was going to receive treatment and what kind of treatment I would have. I was not quite grasping the fact that I had stage 4 lung cancer. I was hearing a lot of different things from the various oncologists I was seeing. I ended up choosing to be enrolled in a stage I trial of immunotherapy at Mass General Hospital in Boston. I received three treatments of immunotherapy with 3 weeks in between each treatment. I had some side effects that became troubling. It started with fevers. My friend Jessie took me to the ER up here in Maine I didn't receive many answers at that time. Then I went to stay at my dads in Darien CT and I still wasn't feeling well. Luckily Traci took me to Norwalk hospital and they performed more tests. My oxygen was extremely low and I had a slight fever. My lungs were inflamed and the urged me to go to Boston. Two days later I was in Boston receiving scans. They typically use different dyes to be able to see things more clearly. I'd had many of these tests before. However for some reason this time I had an allergic reaction to the IV dye they used during the CT scans. I ended up getting lots of Benadryl and eventually was OK. But they sent me to my radiologist office and informed me that most of my medical team was on their way. My oncologist showed up as well as a few other doctors and my radiologist. My oncologist proceeded to tell me that they were going to have to pull me out of the immunotherapy trial and switch me to chemo. My radiologist informed me that I had 3 new small spots on my brain. ( I originally had one spot on my brain that they originally got rid of with radiation). I also had a new small spot on my adrenal gland. I was completely devastated. I couldn't stop crying and my mind was so jumbled. I couldn't think of one question to ask or even a word to say. It was also the first time I was in an appointment alone. Basically I learned I would have to have radiation on my brain again and start chemotherapy in 3 weeks. They did the radiation a few days later. Luckily the spots on my brain were very small and the radiation is so precise I would never know I had it if I wasn't awake during the procedure.Apparently immunotherapy doesn't penetrate the blood barrier around the brain. However chemotherapy does. I think it was in July when all this happened. Three weeks later I realized how foggy the immunotherapy had made me. I began to feel more like myself again emotionally and mentally. I started the chemotherapy. I had some side effects but nothing horrific. I had scans ( no dye during CT Scans) about 3-6 weeks later. It showed shrinkage in my original tumor in my lung. My brain scan was clear and the spot on my adrenal gland had almost disappeared. So they continued with the chemotherapy. I've had 3 or 4 scans since and each one shows more shrinkage! I will continue to do chemo until it stops producing results. I keep my attitude as positive as I can. I try not to think about bad endings. It really is one day at a time. I am blessed to have my 2 beautiful children. I am so lucky to have so many wonderful and caring friends and family members. I can't thank you all enough for the support love and kindness you all have shown. I love all of you and I am so grateful for each and every one of you. I will try to update you all more often.

She will continue for one more year of less intense chemo. We are very happy to have reached this landmark. Thank you all for your prayers and support and we look to the Lord for the coming year. -The Naftzger FamilyAt \"\"Le Petit\"\" Cafe+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Tim Ñaftzger 19 months ago Share 11 Dear friends and family we are currently at the clinic as Katie begins an initial 9-week intensive chemo treatment. The doctors at UCLA have decided that the best treatment would be two years of chemotherapy instead of a stem cell transplant (for now). For months we have been preparing for the transplant but somehow a recent change in opinion has caused the doctors to reconsider her treatment plan. The stem cell transplant is now more of a last resort. We are at peace with this way and feel that it is quite sovereign. Although this is very hard I believe something very precious is being formed in Katie through this experience.2 Cor. 4:7-18 -\"\"We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; Persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us but life in you. And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written “I believed therefore I spoke” we also believe therefore we also speak Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will make us stand before Him with you.For all things are for your sakes that the grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us more and more surpassingly an eternal weight of glory Because we do not regard the things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary but the things which are not seen are eternal.\"\"At the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society event+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Tim Ñaftzger 19 months ago Share From Mom: \"\"Received summary report from the UCLA Medical Center\\'s Transplant Coordinator today - the private testing from Kashi Labs yielded no good donor match for Katie.

Please stand with us in prayer for wisdom as to which treatment option to choose.\"\" From Tim: \"\"At this point we will be postponing the search for a donor through private testing. If anyone still feels like they may be a match I recommend going to Bethematch.org. Thank you!!+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Tim Ñaftzger 20 months ago Share From Mom: We are grateful for the contributions and prayers from everyone. About half of the money raised went toward the private testing of finding a potential donor for Katie. So far 44 test kits were returned and tested no match has been found yet for Katie. 23 are still in process to be tested and we should have those results by next week. In the meantime Katie is tolerating the outpatient chemotherapy well and continues to gain strength day by day. An umbilical cord unit was found on the public registry and that matches 83% to Katie’s HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen). If no match is found from the private testing Katie could go with the cord unit transplant. At this time we do not know yet when the transplantation would happen.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 13 Posted by Michael Lindquist 8 months ago Share It's been about a year and a half since Lisa was first diagnosed with cancer. It's been a journey filled with low lows and high highs. Yesterday we were able to celebrate one of those highs as Bennett turned 1 year old. Despite being born 2 months early and just over 4 ounces he's just a normal 1-year-old now. He's crawling all over our house getting into all kinds of trouble and doing cute things everyday. He's somewhere around 25 pounds now. Looking at him you would never know that he was born premature.A year ago was an uncertain future with both Lisa and Bennett. Despite Lisa's best efforts otherwise she still had to undergo chemotherapy. It was terrible to watch her go through that period seeing her feel nauseous and sick all the time after treatment. The worst was in October around Halloween which just so happened to be the last treatment she got. It seemed like she was sick for days. Her doctors said she still needed more but we had had enough.She continues to work with her homeopathic doctor in Colorado. She last saw him in May and he said he was doing great. It was just over a year ago when she first saw him and I think he was very surprised and extremely concerned to see the condition she was in just over a year ago.Fast forward a year and things are so much better. Her last visit with him he said her immune system is finally back to the level of any healthy person. He believes she had been struggling with some parasites for a long time which he now believes are gone. And most importantly he believes that Lisa is in remission with her cancer or at least very close to it.Lisa's lifting Bennett and carrying him around the house every day as well as doing most things any housewife would do. That isn't to say she doesn't have challenges. She's still in constant pain every day with her back. She gets relief when she lays down and rests but it's still a struggle. Having 4 children at home during the summer would be difficult for almost anyone I think.We've had Lisa's cousin Jurnee living with us since the end of March. She's here to help Lisa with the kids and to help keep the house in order which is extremely needed with kids who are professional house destroyers especially one energetic 3-year-old (but we won't name any names Tyler).Some of you know that I lost my job back in April. That was bittersweet. It's certainly not great to unexpectedly lose a job but at the same time I had become extremely frustrated with the situation at my work and I was already looking for a new job. I took the first 2 weeks after I lost my job to go to HVAC school so I could become more versed with that aspect of my career as well as to hopefully open new doors and opportunities because of it. I spent about 2 months out of work but was offered a job with a property management company here in the DFW area and started this past week.I'm still so extremely grateful for the kindness and generosity so many of you showed us over the past year. It was nice having Facebook remind me yesterday on Bennett's birthday about all of you who were praying for us wishing us well and giving. Thank you.We continue on here in the Lindquist family despite the challenges we face we are willing to accept them and to keep pressing onward.P.S. - Included are a couple of pictures of Bennett enjoying the taste of chocolate cake for the first time. I'm pretty sure he's a fan.+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Michael Lindquist 14 months ago Share Today Lisa had her 3 week followup appointment after her surgery. She had 2 incisions from the surgery one of the front of her neck and one on the back of her neck right along her spine. The front incision was just taped with bandages that were removed. The incision looks great and has healed very nicely. The incision was made along a natural wrinkle in her neck so once it's healed completely it will be hard to tell where it actually was. It will just blend in with the natural wrinkle in her neck. The back incision was stitched up and today those stitches were removed. Overall everything is healing nicely.We got some great news from her surgery today. The vertebrae that they removed was sent to pathology to be tested for the presence of cancer. Numerous different tests were done and they all came back NEGATIVE!So what does that mean? Well I think we can positively conclude that in at least that vertebrae whatever cancer was there was eradicated. It's uncertain the status of the other areas of her back that had fractures of what cancer may still be in any of those areas however I think it's remarkable that in at least one area where cancer was known to be that her body likely through a combination of chemotherapy and a strict diet seemed to have been enough to stop the cancer and eliminate it.That was a very happy moment for both of us. Lisa has other test scheduled for the coming weeks to take another look at her back and how her healing is progressing there.Another good thing that she's been able to do is slowly ween herself off of some of her pain meds. When she first came home from Colorado she was taking 120 mg of morphine (60 mg 2X/day) everyday. She was able to ween herself down to 90 mg/day (30 mg 3X/day and right now she's down to 60 mg/day (30 mg 2X/day). Soon she hopes to get down to 45 mg/day.Progress is slow but it's coming. Thank you for your continued support and prayers.+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Michael Lindquist 14 months ago Share Hey everyone (it's Lisa). I have been wanting to get on here for a while and give a big huge THANK YOU to everyone who has shown so much love and support over this past year. I have truly seen the hand of God in my life through all of you and have been strengthened by all of you. It is especially humbling to be the beneficiaries of such generous kind and thoughtful people. Life would be a whole lot different if it weren't for all the support we have received. Thank you. Thank you doesn't seem adequate but I'm not sure how else to express how grateful I am. I can't wait till we are all in heaven together and I can give each and every one of you a big hug and express my gratitude on a more personal level. I love you all and while I hope no one ever has to go through what we have had to go through I am anxiously waiting for an opportunity to pay it all forward! Merry Christmas!! Thank you for showing me who Christ truly is and allowing me to experience His healing power charity and love. + Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Michael Lindquist 14 months ago Share Surgery is over and was a success.

       " \"Update 8 Posted by Amanda Arquette 16 months ago Share Update! I wish it were a little brighter but we're still optimistic! So Andrew has two factors that put him into the high risk category- his age and an inherited gene variation. Since he is considered high risk he has to undergo another 60-day cycle of intense chemo. This cycle is very similar to the cycle he had when he was first diagnosed which was tough on him. His blood counts are expected to drop putting him a risk for severe side effects and infections. A fever could put him in the hospital for weeks. But the good news is if he has no delays and no cancer cells at the end of the cycle he will have a final (less intense) 60-day course and then should be able to go into his 3 year maintenance treatments! Please pray that he stays strong and gets through the next 60 days without any issues which he starts on the 27th of October. You're so brave Andrew and we are all here for you! Anything we can do to help his family get through yet another challenging time will help so much!

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Julie Franks 14 months ago Share Hi EveryoneI made it through Chemo skidding across the finish line in flames but nonetheless completed! I still deal with lingering side effects and the doctors expect this to be the case for at least a few more months. Shortly after the completion of Chemo I met with my reconstructive surgeon to continue the process that began with my first surgery. There was a 50/50 chance that this next surgery wouldn’t take. I would know once the surgery was over whether just one or a few more surgeries will be needed. I blindly went into surgery on 11/30 just after Thanksgiving. Fortunately the reconstruction team did a great job and I will only need about one more procedure. I was out of work for 2 ½ weeks on unpaid leave while I recovered. I was just able to get back to work this week. Everyone I work with has been incredibly supportive and understanding.A few weeks after Chemo ended I began my next course of treatment with my Oncologist. My Hormone Therapy is still in the acute phase which will last a few more months while levels and medications are fine tuned. During this time random side effects will continue to bombard me and it will be a matter of playing a game of whack a mole to get them all stabilized. Once stabilized I will be on this treatment for ten more years. Thank you all for your continued love and support. I could not have made it through this time without all of you helping me support myself and my daughter through all of these treatments and unpaid leaves from work. Suffice it to say that my New Year’s resolution is to say buh bye to cancer!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Julie Franks 16 months ago Share Hi Everyone Jani again! In an effort to keep my body strong enough to allow the fourth and final infusion I had to cut back to 30 hours a week last week. This will last for about a month. The new strategy worked and I quickly recovered enough to move forward with infusing last Thursday! In a couple weeks I’ll meet with my plastic surgeon and oncologist to discuss the next steps in both treatment and reconstruction. Dear CancerIt's been real. After countless sleepless nights I've determined that we should break up now.You're quite time consuming and I don't appreciate your narcissistic tendencies. Consider this your eviction notice effective immediately. Not much loveChemo in Heels+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Julie Franks 17 months ago Share Hi Everyone!It's Jani.. First off I wanted to thank you all for your love and support. I am seriously blown away by all of you. The past 6 months have been quite a ride and I never would have made it this far without your help prayers and positive energy. Round two of Chemo didn’t go as swimmingly as I would have hoped. Blood counts dropped and I of course caught whatever creeping crud was lurking around my daughter’s first grade classroom. That in addition to complications of side effects left my doctors and I questioning whether I would be stable enough to receive round three. Thankfully we got matters under control just enough to move forward and keep on schedule. I began round three of Chemotherapy last week. They weren’t kidding when they said side effects of the therapy were cumulative. Meaning they get worse and last longer each round. We are still struggling to get side effects from round three under control enough so that I can return to work. My main focus right now is keeping my body strong enough to receive the fourth and final round in October. I’ve been blessed in that I’ve been able to power through working full time until this point and being a mommy while undergoing Chemo thanks in no small part to both my family and partner Fab. That being said I am really excited to get this part over and done with. Next up I have a couple of surgeries (sure why not) after Camp Chemo is complete and after that they like to treat us to an all-inclusive getaway to hormone therapy for about a decade. No joke. A decade. Suffice it to say that the ride’s not over yet. It could be better it could be a heck of a lot worse. Overall there have been so many blessings that have come out of this that it is hard to focus on the negatives. The positives are just shining too much light into the dark.Thanks everyone for your love and support!Jani at Round 3 of Chemo!Jani & Julie at Round 2 of Chemo!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Julie Franks 19 months ago Share Hey Everyone! Thanks again for all your love prayers and support - it has meant so much to Jani as she continues this journey. After a successful double mastectomy in June she started her first round of chemotherapy on Thursday. Jani is in great spirits but is feeling really sick from the treatment. She is taking a strong drug that is producing a lot of tough side effects pain and fatigue. If you know Jani it takes a lot to keep her in bed for a day! But through all of this she is still upbeat and positive. So... one course of treatment down three more to go! She'll be done with chemo in October then will have reconstructive surgery likely by the end of the year.Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers - she needs it during this tough time as she continues to work and be a mommy to her daughter Reign. We are so grateful to all of you who have called posted and texted encouragement and kind words... she feels very loved! Sharing her Go Fund Me page will help her continue to weather this financial hardship and support her journey through breast cancer and onward toward her cure. So thankful to everyone who has donated - we appreciate you!! MAHALO & PLEASE SHARE! :)Jani at her first chemo treatment!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

In case any of you haven\\'t already seen some posts he went for his MRI and it showed the tumor has disappeared. This does not mean that he is out of the woods but it gives us hope and that\\'s all we can ask for now. It also doesn\\'t mean he is cured he still has DIPG. What the plan is now is to continue to have an MRI every 8 weeks and also take meds. The medicene that he will be taking is used for transplant patients therefore the insurance company has denied payment. The cost of this medication is $15000. a month. He will take it for the rest of his life.. We will be having fundraisers to help with cost of medicene. Our next big fundraiser is on May 12th designer bag bingo so let me know if you want tickets.

       " '\"Update 5 Posted by Werner Ochoa 8 months ago Share As most of you know by now Beverly had a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) in September of 2016 at Johns Hopkins and in October we received the news that it did not eradicate the Lymphoma. In November she was placed on Immunotherapy to combat her cancer through medications alone but in spite of being a very tough treatment due to its side-effects she endured it to the end. This February she had a PET Scan that showed continued Lymphoma activity and was decided that the next and definitive step was a second Bone Marrow Transplant through a donor. All the Ochoas went through testing to see who would be a match. Madelina and I were potential donors (50%) but Patrick ended up being close to a perfect match! After a short but intense round of Chemo the second BMT took place on March 8th. Beverly received the Bone Marrow well but Patrick had a complication that kept him overnight. He was discharged a day later. In order to monitor her recovery she needed daily visits for bloodwork at the Hospital so she moved into a Johns Hopkins Family Center apartment next to the hospital. On May 5th she had a PET Scan and was healthy and strong enough to be discharged home!! On May 10th we received the news we\\'ve been waiting for almost 18 months Beverly was on remission! No more cancer!She continued to have visits every other week to monitor her progress and for the months of July through September she will have monthly check ups. As she continues to get stronger we pray that by September (6 months after BMT) she will be healthy enough to get her immunization shots.We could not have gone through this journey alone God has been our strength and the financial and emotional support that all of you our neighbors coworkers friends and spiritual family have provided to us has been amazing.We continue to make adjustments to provide Beverly with what she needs for a full recovery. Our financial obligations continue to put a strain into our finances for which we continue to ask you to pray for us and if you are able to help us will be greatly appreciated.+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Werner Ochoa 16 months ago Share We will never tire of thanking you for your prayers words of encouragement and expressions of support during this journey! She had been recovering well after the Bone Marrow Transplant and we were looking forward to her final PET scan last week. But with heavy hearts we share that on Friday the PET scan showed Lymphoma activity on her abdomen even after the transplant and that it has spread to her jaw bone...As Beverly\\'s fight goes on to a third round we ask you to continue to pray that she remains encouraged and strong and for a treatment that will finally bring her to remission. We will continue to update you as we know more and once again thank you for your support!!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Werner Ochoa 17 months ago Share Thank you all so much for your prayers and support!! Words cannot express how grateful we are for the words of encouragement prayers for healing and strength and for helping us financially to cover the costs of treatment and living arrangements that are not covered by our health insurance.During Werner and Madelina\\'s birthdays Beverly was admitted for 8 straight days of chemotherapy to reboot her immune system and on Sep. 20th she had the Bone Marrow Transplant. Since it\\'s a \"\"new\"\" immune system the day of the transplant became day 0. Days 1-5 were key to see how her body was going to react to the \"\"new\"\" stem cells even if the transplant was Autologous. She did well until the end of Day 5 when she developed a fever which later on blood work revealed that it was an infection in her blood. Her infection was treated with antibiotics and was resolved in the following days but in the evenings she continues to have a low grade fever.Today is Day 12 and her steady recovery has permitted the doctors to discharge her from the hospital and transfer her to the Family Center right across the hospital. That way she will be able to come into the hospital for daily follow ups; these follow ups will become less frequent in the coming months as she continues to recover until she is considered well enough to move back home!Once again THANK YOU so much for all your wishes prayers and support. We will keep you updated :-)+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Werner Ochoa 18 months ago Share 11 We are so thankful to God that Beverly finished her ICE Chemo Treatment a couple of weeks ago!! She has been having a battery of tests to have clearance and move forward with the Stem Cell Transplant; we have been traveling to and from Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Sydney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center for the last few weeks. She is now starting the Stem Cell Mobilization with Cytoxan and Neupogen around 9/8 she will have pheresis to extract the healthy stem cells and freeze them on 9/12 she will be admitted for more chemotherapy and on 9/20 have them re-infused (transplanted). Once transplant takes place and everything goes as planned she\\'ll be in the hospital for about 10-15 days and then discharged to an in-house living arrangement for another 45-60 days.We cannot thank you enough for your prayers support and kind words of encouragement!

       " '\"Update 6 Posted by Alex Hwang 13 months ago Share Hello! It\\'s been awhile but I was waiting for the right time to share an update on Mama Hwang. Spoiler alert: GOOD NEWS.After her successful surgery this past summer Mama Hwang began her chemo treatments through the fall and winter which were a combination of injections and oral medication. It was extremely painful at first but with the proper dosage changes and additional medication she was able to stabilize a 4 week cycle for each round of the eight chemo sessions. With the incredible support and love from friends and family in Korea (and with the amazing support of this GoFundMe campaign) she has been able to eat properly be surrounded by loved ones and fight this cancer with hope courage and grace.Her last chemo session was last week and her last test & doctor visit will be on Valentine\\'s Day February 14th. We hope that the doctor will give her the final OK to come back home.HOME - here in Los Angeles with her family her church her friends Kobe and Jackie (our dogs). Home to Myung Dong Kal Guk Soo.All of the funds have been used to pay for chemo help maintain her stay in Korea along with additional medicine to get her through all of the chemo. We are now using the last bit of additional funds that recently came through (thank you!) to be buy plane tickets for her return in addition to her round-trip flight back to Korea for a check-up in June.It will be roughly nine months since we first found out that Mama Hwang was diagnosed with stomach cancer and I\\'ll always remember this because it coincides when I got married to my beautiful bebeh Susan. Today I turn 31 and looking back on my last year my supposed \"\"golden year\"\" of being 30 on January 30th - I can\\'t help but turn my gaze away from me me me to all of us together. Not in a shallow kumbaya-everything-will-be-peachy kind of together because last year was global reminder of how far we still have to go but that each of us is all we\\'ve got and all we are.So please hug someone either with your arms your money your time your love etc. All of your hugs for Mama Hwang have turned into $20836 and the eager return of a healthy and cancer-free mother wife friend and daughter of God. God bless you all. + Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Alex Hwang 19 months ago Share Hi everyoneI\\'ve been in Korea for the last four days. I\\'ve been with my mom in Seongnam-si at my uncle\\'s apt. My parents\\' pastor\\'s daughter Melissa has been an amazing roommate for my mom before and during my stay.The routine for the next couple months will be the following:1) Chemo injection (3 hours)2) A week of intense pain throwing up badass cancer fighting3) A week of recovery4) A week of calm5) Rinse and repeatI was able to make it during the week of calm before the next cycle begins tomorrow. We\\'ve been finding foods that she could enjoy (pho! big seedless korean grapes etc) My wife Susan will be coming later this week and my brother will be visiting for a week starting Sunday. My mom\\'s sister-in-law who took care of her during the first session of chemo will also be coming tomorrow to stay with her during the week of pain. She is an incredible saint and I can\\'t wait to see her.Between her family friends friend\\'s children - we have a lot of love surrounding Mama Hwang. But she still feels anxious about tomorrow\\'s treatment and the fight can be draining weary and hopeless as times. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers.Each visit every three weeks can cost anywhere between $700-$1500 depending on what tests need to be done what additional nutrition and patches are needed to help her body get through the chemo.Although we have exceeded beyond our fundraising campaign goal I am keeping the gofundme open as there continues to be ongoing costs of lodging food (when she can keep it down) and general wellness.We\\'re so fortunate to have so many people to turn to and to come visit her personally. All the funds all the thoughts and prayers and all the visits it has all made this fight worth fighting and she is constantly reminded of how many people care about her.THANK YOU. getting vitamin C injection pre-chemo+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Alex Hwang 19 months ago Share Hello everyoneI\\'m hoping this will be the final update until the very end when Mama Hwang returns home cancer-free.She started chemotherapy last week with a combination of ingestible medication and injections for the next six months in Korea. She\\'ll be going to the hospital every three weeks for injections and taking medication daily.The first rounds of chemo I\\'ve heard are the hardest and it\\'s been heartbreaking to know that she\\'s in pain even from talking outloud. The one time I was able to call her she broke down in sobs and had to pass the phone over to her sister-in-law. Fortunately she has a place to stay close to the hospital but will be needing as much personal care as possible.I\\'m leaving for Korea a week earlier than my band in order to be with her. Along with my brother and dad we\\'re trying to make our way over to her as much as possible as well as use the additional GoFundMe money to help pay for a possible home care nurse. If anyone has any leads it would be really appreciated.Thank you once again for all the prayers funds messages and support. I\\'m going to find a way to thank everyone.Here is the most recent photo that my brother posted. I love you Mom. We love you Mama Hwang. + Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Alex Hwang 20 months ago Share This continues to grow beyond expectations. We\\'ve received over $6K more than the goal of $13K from over 150 donors. Over 500 people on Facebook shared Mama Hwang\\'s story and the GoFundMe page has been visited over 4000 times (500 of those visits may have been mine). I was attempting to thank every individual donation but I think the best way to do so is to give an update on her condition and what exactly we will be doing with the generous funds.UPDATE:My mother is currently with her brother and his wife in Daejeon (2 hours south of Seoul) recovering from the successful surgery that removed the stomach cancer along with 2/3 of her stomach. She will be removing the remaining stitches at a local hospital and learning to eat/drink with most of her stomach gone. As I was talking to her yesterday she seems in good spirits. She gets full from one cup of water and the most she could eat (after many chews) is a small banana.The doctors back at Samsung hospital have scheduled for her to come back to Seoul on July 20th to determine the type of chemotherapy and go from there.Please pray and hope with us that the cancer has not grown or spread in turn making the chemotherapy less intense (fingers crossed for just ingestible medication).As of now the GoFundMe funds will be able to cover the surgery completely and the remaining will be on hold until the doctors determine the chemotherapy schedule. All funds will be available for Mama Hwang to cover the chemotherapy as well as lodging and transportation expenses.Every day I think I\\'m going to close the campaign another donor sends money. I let my mom know every time and it\\'s been such a blessing. Thank you and I can\\'t wait to have her back home and close the campaign by having a photo of her back with her family :)We love you Mama Hwang.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Thank you to everyone who donated and shared this GoFundMe to help her and her family pay for treatment while she fiercely battled cancer.Karolina was a staunch advocate always giving always looking for new ways to help people in need. Thank you for giving to help her when she needed it most.Love always.+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Chrisula Tasiopoulos 10 months ago Share Karolina has been in Phoenix getting treatment which she has responded well to. Unfortunately the treatment costs $6500 PER WEEK and not covered by insurance and doesn't include all of her other needs such as medication transportation food and other basic necessities. On top of that she is there by herself with friends and family on occasion making a trip out to be with her so that she's not totally alone.This is a very difficult journey and has been very painful. Please share again and encourage others to continue to donate. Thank you.+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Chrisula Tasiopoulos 14 months ago Share Hello dear friends of Karolina.Karolina posted an update recently on her Facebook page to let everyone know that she is heading to a clinic in Germany to try immunotherapy. This isn't offered in the U.S. and will wipe out all of her funding. In the last few months she has experienced some losses and has spent a considerable amount of time in the hospital.But we all know Karolina and she won't give up - and neither will we! Please share this and if you can make a donation. Every little bit helps and Karolina is of course incredibly grateful for everyone's support. Thank you!+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Chrisula Tasiopoulos 15 months ago Share Thanks to everyone again for your donations and for sharing her page. As you can see we're just about halfway to our goal.Karolina has spent most of November in the hospital as a result of new pain that the doctors cannot seem to figure out. The pain paralyzed part of her face and tongue and made it difficult for her to walk. Her scans have revealed that the cancer has not changed since her last scans in June - which is good news since this means the cancer has not progressed.In order to stabilize the pain and allow her to travel to continue receiving treatment in Reno NV she has had to go through chemotherapy in NJ which has led to anemia. This Friday she will be receiving a blood transfusion to help with that. She has been feeling better as of late and still hopes to return to her treatment in Nevada which as been far less damaging to her body than the traditional treatment for cancer.Please continue to share and encourage others to donate. If anyone is interested in partnering to help raise money through additional means such as hosting a party of some kind etc. please let me know. Thank you again for your continued support.Kar's art therapy which helps her copeKarolina with her niece+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Amy Jones 7 months ago Share Update:For all those who think of me and say a prayer I say KEEP IT UP and THANKS BE TO GOD!! I am so blessed to have your continued thoughts prayers and positive vibes. My most recent CT has shown stability in my condition which is GREAT news. I am doing my very best to live life to the fullest a priority that often forms after receiving a poor prognosis attached to a much lower life-expectancy than anyone would want. I am feeling fairly well and enjoying so many wonderful days and making fantastic memories with my loved ones... stability equals the precious gift of time. Pain and digestive malfunction are my primary challenges but I am scheduled for another celiac plexus block for pain management- and it is nothing your prayers can’t handle ?. The metal stent in the left lobe has been working very well too. God bless each and every one of you <3 + Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Amy Jones 12 months ago Share Dear FriendsIt has been a little over a year since I heard that I have a rare and aggressive cancer called Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma…and that I should expect to survive for 6 months to 3 years- and the latter only if I was very lucky. Well as one who believes in a power higher than Lady Luck I find myself one year into a battle that continues. Yes this is a formidable beast to deal with. And I would be dishonest if I didn’t admit that it is a difficult fight to wage day in and day out. But with the continuous love care support and prayer that I am blessed with I soldier on with an army of good people walking beside me to bring me relief inspiration and access to the weapons that give me a fighting chance to remain on this life’s journey for as long as possible. I have discovered some of the greatest keys to loving and living because of this condition and count myself as one who is blessed in great abundance. YOU have enabled me to keep going. YOU have demonstrated how wondrously we are made in the image and likeness of God reflected so beautifully by your selflessness and compassion. Words will never suffice so we simply pray for each and every one of you. The fight continues as the cancer has slowly progressed but has not prevented me from experiencing immeasurable joy such as the arrival of my first grandchild. God is good- ALWAYS. Thank you for your generous support and continued prayers. Onward!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Amy Jones 17 months ago Share As promised for all of those who are walking with me on this unfamiliar pathway shining your light so I can keep going no matter how dark it can get in the shadows...here is the most recent findings following chemo and radiation. The report states there is a 3% increase in the tumor. At first glance our radiation oncologist in Boston thought the tumor appeared to be slightly decreased but actual data comparing the last MRI measurement shows a slight increase. We will continue to do everything possible to stay on top of any new issues (like pain- from a cranky pancreas or healing a duodenal hernia) and have complete and total faith and trust in God- He always brings the greatest good from even the most terrible sufferings. All will be well. In the near future we are heading back to Boston in November for stents to be upsized and I am going to obtain a PET scan to clear up some ambiguities in the recent scans. Your continued prayers are a treasure to me and I am so thankful for the countless blessings this battle has revealed in my life. <3+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Amy Jones 20 months ago Share Fund for Mom of 12 Fighting Cancer has reached 53% of its goal. Thank you to all of our amazing donors!! You have blown us away with your generosity. We are so humbled as we embark on the radiation journey starting this week.

       " \"Update 1 Posted by Kat Sedlak 59 months ago Share Emmy had her surgery on Wednesday and she is slowly recovering now. She is in some pain but she's being her usual Emmy-self - staying positive and keeping her head high. She will start chemo in about one month. Her friends are constantly visiting and making her laugh hopefully speeding up her recovery. Cory (boyfriend) Abby (sister) Trent (Abby's boyfriend) and her Father have been taking care of her around the clock. I have had some inquiries about where the money will go especially considering she has health insurance. It would be a crime if someone as loving as Emmy couldn't have kids so she is taking steps to hopefully ensure her ability to do so in the future. The fertility treatments are incredibly expensive - it has already cost approximately $6000 and insurance doesn't cover the fertility treatments. It also costs money just to store her eggs.Her cancer is one of the most aggressive forms one can get so she will have to visit the doctor every 3 months for the rest of her life to make sure the cancer doesn't come back.Thank you again for all of your donations prayers thoughts and love. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 14 Posted by Beth Parsons 17 months ago Share Post from Sue today: When you look at this photo you probably just see Lane holding a basketball. When I look at this photo I see my determined handsome husband holding his lifeline. He was the picture of health between work & the basketball court he was always active. To be honest over the last eight years he has wore me out with some basketball! There were times I despised the word! If you know my husband \"\"Basketball never stops\"\". He eats sleeps & breathes it. I think its safe to say anytime you see Lane Acord or hear someone say Lane Acord you think of basketball! Today I am so thankful thankful for the many things this orange rubber ball has brought to our lives. Because of it Lane has formed unbreakable bonds with so many people of all ages. Out of the kindness of their hearts those people & their families have help support my family the last couple of months. There is not a day that goes by that someone doesn\\'t reach out to Lane just to see how he is or to let him know they are praying for us. When his oncologist looks at you and says \"\"everything is in your favor. You\\'re young healthy & in good shape\"\"....without basketball that probably wouldn\\'t have been the case. During our wedding ceremony he promised to love me as much as he loves basketball if that\\'s the case we\\'ll never have a problem! Now I\\'d give anything to have him back out on the court playing & coaching Basketball! Update: He is doing great. He\\'s had some \"\"off\"\" time the last two weeks & it was much needed. The cancer is responding well to treatment. Thank you all for your prayers & support. We have been so blessed. #acordstrong+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Beth Parsons 18 months ago Share Update from Sue: We are giving God the Glory!! Pet scan results: Right photo was in June the yellow is the lymphoma.. Left photo was today. The red is his organs that you can now see!! All I can say is thank you Jesus!! There were several other spots (swollen lymph nodes) that show no signs of cancer now!! The report confirmed some metabolic activity meaning there could still be cancer cells. He completed his first treatment of this phase. A doctor from UVA that now works in Charleston called and confirmed that he will take Lane\\'s case and share treatment with UVA. We had a day full of blessings. Thank you all for your prayers ? #acordstrong #godsgotthis+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Beth Parsons 18 months ago Share Update from Sue: We just arrived at UVA. Today is a big day for Lane. He has a PET scan scheduled this morning & they may start the second phase of his treatment. We are praying this scan reveals the miracle we\\'ve been praying for! His labs yesterday showed a drastic improvement in his liver function. The plan for the next eight weeks was to share treatment between UVA & Beckley so that we would not have to be away from home so much. We were informed by Beckley two days prior to treatment that it was too complicated for them. The doctors at UVA are working on a new plan. If you would take a moment of your day and pray for Lane & the results of this PET scan thank you ? #webelieve #acordstrong+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Beth Parsons 19 months ago Share Update from Sue: When unexpected things happen in life we are often quick to question God. No time is ever a good time for cancer but it sure picked a bad time for us. With buying a home having a baby sending a kid off to college this journey is going to be a true testament of our faith. Lane has several months of treatment ahead of him he will be traveling to and from UVA weekly. Luckily his job is Union & has awesome co-workers looking out for him! My position at work could not be held due to the amount of time I will have to be off to care for him. Instead of asking God why Lane asks God what we can do & thanks God for all he has already done for us. There has been so many evenings over the last eight years that I have set at home alone or with our children while my husband was spending time with other families and their children. He has dedicated so much of his life to others. I personally would like to THANK everyone who has given back. I am in awe of all the love and support our family has received. So many individuals have truly went above and beyond. I look back at all of the times I should of helped someone else in need when I could of gave $5 and didn\\'t. Our outlook on life will be forever changed. Please continue to pray for Lane. Everything is going well with his treatment it\\'s just very hard on his body. The plan is for him to be able to come home this Friday & have a short break before his next phase of treatment begins. Let\\'s pray he has no set backs. I think home would be some very good Medicine for him!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I'm feeling vulnerable and like I'm begging... so this is difficult for me. This past year has kicked my butt! Cancer (duh) lost my job moving lost my health insurance and it took me forever to find a new job which pays far less than I need means I'm exhausted and feeling a little deflated and defeated.I'm almost there... we're almost there... where we were before the nightmare.

       " '\"Update 14 Posted by Victor Minetola 13 months ago Share Dear family and friendsIf you have not heard already my sweet sister Lisa passed away on Tuesday February 7 at 2:42 pm. While we may not have been successful in helping Lisa kick cancer\\'s butt we were successful in helping her know she was loved and cared for throughout. She may have lost this battle but Jesus has won the war. We are going to keep the GoFundMe open for a while as we are still figuring out what out-of-pocket medical expenses remain. Beyond that and moving forward we will be using any money received for Remy and Victor\\'s college funds. I am attaching a link to her obituary and funeral arrangements. Thanks you again for all of your support and prayers. Remember this: death does not have the final word but Jesus who has conquered death and is the first fruits from the grave. To God be the glory.

It appears the inflammatory dermal cancer is back and her magnesium is extremely low. Her time is limited. We don\\'t know how much. The girls and I are heading to Michigan tomorrow to be with her and the family.We all can\\'t thank you enough for joining us on this journey. You have been there to pray with us to encourage us and to donate to help ease the financial burden off of Lisa and Chuck.Please continue to pray over these coming days.\"\"My grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness.\"\" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (2 Corinthians 12:9)v+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Victor Minetola 13 months ago Share I apologize profusely for not getting updates out to all of you sooner. It has been a hard few months and sometimes it\\'s hard to put those things into words.Lisa started a new chemo regimen just before Thanksgiving. The plan was six 21-day cycles which would consist of a Cisplatin infusion on day 1 14 days of Xelota pills and 7 days off. The first cycle severely dehydrated her and sent her to the hospital for a few days of fluids.She went back into the hospital just after Thanksgiving for extreme discomfort. They discovered fluid in the pleura around the lung which contained cancer cells. They put in a port to drain that and saw really good results. They added daily fluid infusions to help with the dehydration resultant from the Cisplatin.She began to develop episodes of discomfort/pain in her legs that was almost unbearable at times. The did some blood work and found that her magnesium was low (which could cause the leg issue) and also that her red blood cell count was low. They gave her an infusion and sent her on her way.Into the third cycle she was managing the symptoms alright. The oncologist planned on doing another CT scan after the fourth cycle. After starting the fourth cycle her symptoms got much worse. She had very little energy and was still having trouble eating. The oncologist decided he wanted to do the CT scan then instead of waiting until the end of the cycle.When she came in he remarked at how he didn\\'t like how she looked. It turns out her red blood count was really low again so they sent her for a blood transfusion. The next morning she looked remarkably better and was feeling a bit better. The oncologist decided to stop the chemo regimen she was on to replace it with something that would hopefully not affect her so severely.The CT scan showed that she still has cancer cells in the pleura some in the lymph nodes on her left side (which we knew about) but also a spot on her left breast and on her spine. The plan is the same—to start the new regimen—but she has to bulk up a bit first (she lost about 10–15 pounds).This past week she has been getting a loopy and confused. There is a possibility that the pain meds they have her on could be contributing to this. She is going for a MRI of her head tonight just to be sure.Please keep praying. Keep spreading the word. She appreciates all of your donations prayers notes and cards.I will update when I know more.Grace mercy and peaceVictor/VJ/veej+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Victor Minetola 16 months ago Share What a week it has been. We went from the highs of Lisa getting to ring the bell as she completed her radiation to the discovery that there is more cancer in her lymphatic system and they are no longer calling her \"\"curable.\"\"That was a huge blow that sucked the wind out of all of us. Now that we\\'ve had a bit to process it and get more info from the doctors here is where things are at:Her medical oncologist said she looks great and is feeling really good. She is very healthy and the cancer is just in a few nodes. He is quite optimistic that this next course of chemo will put her in remission after which she will go on a maintenance drug to keep it under control.She will be doing six 21-day cycles with two chemo agents so we are looking at about 4 months of treatment. Day 1 will be a mega dose of only one of them which will make her feel pretty cruddy for a week.More chemo coupled with the fact that Lisa\\'s (and my Mom\\'s) medical transcription company lost the account they type for (which was all cancer so maybe a blessing in disguise) means that she is going to be in need of more financial help. She also made the decision to cancel her Christmas concert season which brings in a lot of extra cash because she is not sure she will have the energy to get through it.If you have not donated yet please consider. Even the smallest donation helps. $5 $10 whatever you can give.Please keep praying! I am still praying for a miracle and maybe that miracle is that the cancer goes away for good but maybe that miracle is that the chemo and maintenance keeps this damned cancer at bay for years to come. More than anything pray for strength and peace.At the beginning of all of this Lisa put together a playlist of fight songs. At two completely random times yesterday I heard two of them: \"\"Seven Nation Army\"\" by White Stripes and \"\"Pretty Pimpin\\'\"\" by Kurt Vile. Time to fight. Back in the ring.“I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” —John 16:33Grace mercy and peaceVictor/VJ/veejRinging her bell @ the end of raidiation+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

She has neuropathy in her hands and feet along with pain in her hands/fingers and from her knees to her feet. This leaves her very limited to what she can do. After working 26 years at her job they medically terminated her after she had been off a year. Holly has tried a lot of treatments that haven't helped her and there isn't much more to try. She also goes in for a CT scan to check an area they think may be scar tissue every 6 months.Scott had been taking chemo pills every month and having a MRI every 3 months. In April 2017 they saw that Scott's brain cancer is growing again. So he does MRI's every 2 months now and if anything changes at all they want him to take 4 chemos separately for 30 days on and 30 days off and back and forth lIke that. Scott is the only one able to work right now so if his MRI shows a change he says he won't try the chemo because they won't have money for billsfoodetc.That is why they are asking for help. It's hard to wrap your head around all the things that are going on with our family. If you can donate we thank you and appreciate it! If you don't donate please just keep us in your prayers because that is something that helps us a lot.If anyone doesn't like using gofundme or wants to make a direct donation you can email Ana at rotha23@hotmail.com for an address to mail donations to.

       " '\"Update 9 Posted by Kristen Hensley 18 months ago Share It\\'s been a crazy past few weeks with life in general as well as with Luke\\'s battle against leukemia. Luke finished induction II of chemo on Thursday August 25th and experienced no issues during the treatment. He is such a little trooper and handling this all so well! We knew that there was a possibility for us to go home after treatment was complete which we were excited about (but VERY nervous). The educational staff at Cook\\'s started teaching us how to care for his central line on a daily basis how to change his central line caps and dressing on a weekly basis and what medicines he would all need to take at home. It was definitely information overload but we were ready! On Friday morning August 26 our Doctor Dr. Heym came in and said....YOU ARE GOING HOME!!! All I could do was cry tears of joy because our baby boy had not been out of the hospital (or even off the oncology floor) since July 12th!!! After several trips to the car with all of our belongings (we had a ton since we had been there so long) we walked Luke out for the very first time. Poor little guy cried as we left because that\\'s all he knew for over a month and thought it was his \"\"home\"\". It didn\\'t take him long to realize that he finally got to escape and be at his real home with his sisters! That afternoon Lucas Maggie Luke and I all waited in the car line to pick Molly up from school! The look on Luke\\'s face when he saw his sisters was priceless and melted my heart!We enjoyed the weekend together and just spent time as a family of 5. Of course Lucas and I kept taking Luke\\'s temperature every 15 minutes just to make sure we weren\\'t missing anything! We knew before we left the hospital that his blood counts were low and he was very susceptible to infection. Luke definitely lived in a \"\"bubble\"\" that weekend! Lucas and I knew that any bit of fever would send us back to the hospital and were just praying that Luke would stay fever free in order for us to enjoy a couple of weeks at home as a family. Unfortunately Sunday evening around 8:30 Luke started running 101.7. I immediately called the on-call oncology doctor and he told us to go ahead and go into the ER at Cook\\'s. We are blessed with an amazing daycare lady who gladly kept the girls for us that night (and several nights after that). Once in the ER they immediately started to blood cultures in order to check for any type of bacterial infection. We knew that we would be admitted and were prepared for that but it wasn\\'t until 3 am the next morning that we finally made it to the oncology floor and got settled in. Lucas and I were hoping that once Luke was 24 hour fever free that we would be able to go home again. Unfortunately Dr. Heym came in later that morning and let us know that with AML patients they are allowed one chance at home with low counts....and that was our one chance. So...we got the news that we would be in the hospital again until Luke\\'s counts recover. As this has all been an emotional roller coaster for Lucas and I we took this news even harder because we had hope to go back home and be a family again. Luke continued to run fever for the next 7 days which meant that we were not able to get out of the room. He just was not himself and wanted to sleep all day. Lucas and I were just not used to this and got a little spoiled after his first round of chemo since he did so well and didn\\'t experience any issues. The good news is that Luke didn\\'t have a bacterial infection or a fungal infection and after having a chest x-ray his lungs were all clear. Luke did develop mouth sores which is common from the chemo that he received. Dr. Heym is not positive what caused his fever but with all infection tests being negative it is mostly likely from the chemo which again is common. Finally after 7 long days in our room Luke was able to get out and run around! He definitely missed the playroom!The past two days have been pretty eventful with preparation for his bone marrow transplant. The transplant team are working with two live donors in order to get all the necessary procedures performed and a final transplant date set. As transplant will only occur once Luke\\'s blood counts have fully recovered timing will all depend on his body and the availability of donors. The transplant team is planning for transplant to take place early to mid October. In preparation for Luke\\'s transplant he had a ECHO EKG and another chest x-ray yesterday September 6th. All results were normal which is great news! Today September 7th he will have a kidney test to evaluate his kidney functions which is a required procedure prior to transplant. This morning at 5:30 a.m. our poor little boy was woken up to insert a urine catheter and then the IV team came in to put in 2 more IV\\'s in his ankles :( All of this was normal procedure prior to the kidney test which will last between 4 and 5 hours. One of the hardest things I have had to see done to be son and it broke my heart :(And if today hasn\\'t already been rough enough....Dr. Heym broke the news to us that today will most likely be the day that Luke gets his feeding tube. Most children battling cancer end up with a feeding tube because of the affects chemo has on their appetite. Lucas and I were not ready to hear those words but know that in order for Luke to have the best recovery possible his nutrition needs to stay up.Thank you all for the cards donations thoughts prayers and support. Keep praying and Luke will win this battle!!+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Kristen Hensley 18 months ago Share Just as we were all rejoicing that Luke got to head home for a few weeks of \"\"normal life\"\" before his transplant he unfortunately had a setback. Having developed a fever Luke was readmitted to the hospital. Now we all know what a little fighter Luke is but this has been understandably hard on the family who really just hoped for some time with the entire family together at home. No news yet on what this means long term but for now Luke and mom are back at the hospital. Please keep up your prayers as they have worked so far. The family could really use your support and encouragement now more than ever.+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Kristen Hensley 18 months ago Share 11 Luke started induction II of chemo treatment on Wednesday August 17th and will continue until next Wednesday August 24th. His counts did not fully recover before starting this round; however as we were already at day 36 it was standard protocol to go ahead and start. The doctors continue to be amazed at how well Luke is responding to all of the treatment as it hasn\\'t stopped him from running around the halls...eating and drinking....or affected his mood at all! Very blessed and thankful for that!If all goes well the next week we will get to go home for the first time since July 12th! Praying that all goes well and we can go home to \"\"re-energize\"\" and have a little more normal life (as normal as it can be during all of this). Molly starts kindergarten on Monday August 22nd so I have been an emotional wreck between that and everything going on with Luke. She is super excited and I know she will do very well and have tons of fun! She has the sweetest teacher and everybody at school has been super supportive with all of this.As for transplant news....there have been several donors found for Luke!! It is such a blessing to know that the doctors have options and can be \"\"picky\"\" on selecting the perfect match! The transplant is still tentatively scheduled for the end of September and will all depend on how quickly his counts recover from this round of chemo. Baby steps and Luke will win his battle with Leukemia! Keep praying as prayers are being answered! Thank you all again for the cards donations thoughts prayers and support. + Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Kristen Hensley 19 months ago Share Last Wednesday August 3rd Luke had his bone marrow aspiration to test the amount of leukemia cells still present in his bone marrow. Waiting until Friday for results felt like an eternity! We received the news on Friday that Luke is in remission! Day 24 into his battle with leukemia and our strong little fighter is in remission. The bone marrow aspirations showed no leukemia cells which is what we were all hoping and praying for! All of the nurses and doctors were screaming in the halls at the hospital coming up to congratulate Luke and give him the biggest hugs ever! Luke\\'s doctor is so amazed at how well our little guy has responded to the chemo treatment. The first phase of chemo was very intense and his little body responded very very well. So what is next for Luke? Since the bone marrow aspiration showed no leukemia cells we wait for his counts to recover until starting phase 2 of chemo. Phase 2 could start as early as this weekend or as last as next Wednesday. Luke will still go through phase 2 of chemo as it is referred to as the \"\"maintenance\"\" period. This round will not be near as intense as the first one which is a blessing! Phase 2 of chemo will last for 6 days. The doctor informed us today that it is still undecided but there is a possibility that we will get to go home after those 6 days to play the \"\"waiting\"\" game at home instead of in the hospital. We are hoping that we can go home even if it is for a short period of time! If we do we could be back in the hospital at anytime if Luke spikes a fever or experiences any other issues since his counts will be low. The bone marrow transplant will happen after his counts have fully recovered which the doctor says is as early as 6-7 weeks from the start of phase 2 of chemo. At this point we just continue to pray for the doctors to find the perfect match for Luke. We knew that Luke was a fighter and he has shown it every step of the way. This was a HUGE accomplishment for him as it means that he will not have to undergo another very intense round of chemo. Baby steps and he will win this battle! Thank you all again for the thoughts and prayers. Keep praying as prayers are being answered!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

So far it is not too bad just super uncomfortable but the side effects apparently take a week or two to show up. The super fun part is that I also start chemotherapy again today - surprise! Apparently it makes the radiation more effective and since it worked so well on me they want to do it again. Here's hoping it is easier this time around!Brian and I are so sad to leave the children for so long but we know they are in good hands with my family. As Thanksgiving approaches I am not with family undergoing both radiation and chemotherapy and feeling rather yucky but I am still so thankful for the friends and family who hold me up the amazing care and treatment I have received here at MD Anderson and the fact that I am closer and closer to being cancer free! #teamjeannie #givingcancerhellOh these pictures are from radiation - crazy right!?

It will take all day and they will remove 1/2 of my tongue the floor of my mouth my back teeth and possibly some jaw bone. Then they will reconstruct it all using parts of my leg. This will remove the cancer then in about a month I will have radiation to fully cure any microscopic parts left. I will lose my taste buds most likely for good. I am not sure how bad the scarring will be or how long until I will be able to speak or eat properly again. I must confess that my vanity is taking a hit. I took this photo on May 29th after Violet gave me a flower for my hair. Less than 5 months ago and so much has changed.

I am sure I will freak out over the scary surgery soon but right now I am going to face this final chemo treatment with so much gratitude in my heart that while it has been hard everything is moving along perfectly to bring me back to full health.

Words can not express the amount of gratitude and love that your heartfelt contributions have made. I am happy to report that Terrence has completed Chemotherapy and has reduced his cancer down to 5%!!! That is amazing considering when we started this campaign a few short months ago he was at 75%. I come to you now to once again ask that you continue to help Terrence and his family with the difficult road that is ahead. At this time Terrance has exhausted all of the funds that have been raised during this campaign. He has even liquidated all of his assets to include attempting to borrow from his retirement accounts. Unfortunately he doesn't meet the requirements to do so. Terrence is in the process of preparing for stem cell extraction and cell rejuvenation which is a strenuous process and will require a hospital stay of a minimum of 30 days. During this time Terrence will be receiving around the clock care and will not be able to work and provide for his family. Terrence has a long road ahead with treatment and like most of us would not ask for help; but he could use our help. Cancer is an expensive disease to treat and his medical expenses are growing beyond what his insurance provider covers. We ask that you consider donating what you can to help relieve Terrence of the burden of these additional expenses.

There is no way we could have done it without all of you. I truly apologize about falling behind in thank you notes I am caught up now and will work to do better. It has been a very rough week and we are only on Wed. Please follow Teig's journey on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/teigcancer/Our next challenges relate to making it through the next year of chemo etc. We look forward to having t-shirts softball games and maybe a house concert as fundraisers.

We have a Facebook page for Teig on which we post frequent updates on her and her care for anyone interested in following her progress. https://www.facebook.com/teigcancer/+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Albert Harris 19 months ago Share I wanted to thank everyone again. The outpouring of support is truly amazing. The level of money we have raised so far will get us through radiation (the next 1.5 months) which is truly amazing. As many of you know I was the primary earner and can no longer take my job in Illinois which was a huge blow. Additionally Teig needs one of us to stay with her likely at least for the first 6 months. Erin is currently working on an alternate work plan but helping us get past the initial radiation has been so amazing. It truly brings us to tear and we don't know how to thank everyone. Thank you for continuing to root for poor Teig. We got further results back today confirming that her cancer is embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and that it has not spread yet. We are hopeful that the aggressive radiation and chemo treatments will stop it from seeding her brain (this has not yet happened but the tumor is pressing into the inter-cranial space and is directly against the important bits).We will continue to update her progress through the year on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/teigcancer/We truly appreciate all the continued support. I don't know what we would do if we did not have it.LoveAl and family (Erin Kane Roan Blythe Teig)+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 6 Posted by Matt Tamulionis 12 months ago Share To everyone who has donated and shared Max\\'s storyI wanted to update you all that Max passed away last night. He battled as hard as he possibly could but all of the complications through chemo and his transplants proved too difficult to overcome. He is the bravest kid I\\'ll ever know and I\\'ll miss him so much.Thank you all who supported Max and all of the family around him. His battle touched people all along the Northeast and it\\'s safe to say all of your love knows no bounds. -Matt+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Matt Tamulionis 16 months ago Share Good morning everyoneIt\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve updated so I wanted to fill everyone in concerning Max\\'s progress. His big day was on Monday: surgery day. After about 8 hours under the knife the amazing doctors and surgeons at Boston Children\\'s removed 95% of his tumor. Max was an absolute champ throughout the whole process.The doctors noticed that every part of the mass that they removed was solid and hard which is an indication that the cancer cells are dead. The small part that they couldn\\'t get was behind Max\\'s kidney shaped like a dumbbell. However since the parts they removed were dead cancer cells the doctors feel confident that the part they couldn\\'t get is dead as well.The next steps include a few more rounds of chemo radiation and immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is the process of re-introducing the stem cells that were harvested from Max throughout his treatment in the hospital. This will ensure that there won\\'t be a single cancer cell left in his body.Max is awake and doing well. He\\'s obviously very sore but like this entire process he\\'s taking things a day at a time.There is obviously a lot of work and treatment to be done still but what an incredibly huge step in the right direction. We can\\'t thank everyone enough. We were at first blown away by the overwhelming amount of generosity through this GoFundMe but everyone has gone so far beyond this small page in terms of support. People have spread awareness from Massachusetts all the way down to Florida.There aren\\'t any words to express our gratitude. + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Matt Tamulionis 18 months ago Share Hello allWhat a rollercoaster ride this has been. I will try to compile the past few weeks as best I can.In addition to the cancer Max has a disease called \"\"HLH\"\". This in short has been the reason why Max\\'s organs to be inflamed namely his stomach. It could\\'ve surfaced from 1 of 2 things--either this was genetic or it came about from stress/chemo. Because of this Max had to be moved to the ICU floor in Children\\'s. This didn\\'t change his treatment plan just made it more challenging. They put Max on a steroid which ultimately made him feel better. Obviously this was a setback but it was good in the sense that he was being monitored on a much more frequent basis. The biggest thing for Max was he could not eat or drink until his stomach inflammation had subsided. A thirsty Max is not a happy Max.There was a point where the doctors thought they may have had to operate on Max as there was fluid building around his heart. This caused his heart to work extra hard giving an average of 168 BPM with no signs of slowing. The steroid was supposed to help with this but it doesn\\'t work instantly. Thankfully it worked in enough time where surgery didn\\'t have to happen.As of this morning things have become much more stable. His vitals are normal and the doctors seem to think the fluid around his heart will dissipate on its own. We\\'re hoping he\\'ll get to move out of ICU and back into his regular room soon.He offered free Hawaiian Punch to all of the doctors who helped him but he told the oncology team that they\\'re not allowed to have any because they won\\'t let him eat.Again I\\'d like you guys to continue following Max\\'s blog at https://maxisafighter.wordpress.com/. It\\'s updated much more frequently through the good and the bad. I\\'ll keep posting as often as I can as well.+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Matt Tamulionis 19 months ago Share Hello everyoneWe received some unfortunate news today. Max received another CT scan to check on the status of his tumor and unfortunately it has grown larger. Essentially the first round of chemo did not have any affect. Since the size of the tumor has grown the doctors seem to think that it is starting to weigh on his kidney which would explain why his fevers have not been getting below 101.Because of this the plan of action has changed. The original plan was to work Max up with the chemo basically starting \"\"light\"\" and then going harder with each additional round. Now they are going to start what would be the 3rd round of chemo as soon as possible. The goal is to still obviously shrink the mass but the doctors are convening with the surgeons to see if there is any possiblility to remove the kidney entirely even though the tumors tail is wrapped around Max\\'s abdomen. There will be more on that as soon as we hear.Max is hanging in there but has been very tired for the most part from all of the medicine. It\\'s still great to see him perk up and play some video games or to hear him boss us around. You have all done wonders in terms of keeping a positive attitude and keeping Max in your thoughts. Please continue to do so! Although this is a setback Max continues to fight hard every single day. -Matt + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I asked how long I have and they can not really tell me. He said I possible could live a long time but it is just to hard to say I guess at this point. I am going for a second opinion. This is also hard for me as I will be getting a reduced pay. I do try to work the very next day after Chemo even though I am in such pain and so tired I am still trying to working I should be home recouping but if I do that I loose my pay.

       " '\"Update 60 Posted by Danielle Lien 41 months ago Share It is AMAZING how much can change in just 1 year!!! 1 year ago today my world came crashing down. 1 year ago today I learned my breast cancer was back had spread and was more aggressive. 1 year ago today I made the most difficult decision of my life and closed my cheer gym so I could focus on fighting cancer and getting better. But the nightmare actually began 2 years ago. On May 10th 2013 2 months to the day after my 32nd birthday I was Diagnosed with stage 1-a invasive Breast Cancer. Moms on The Run has paid for my Mammogram ultrasound biopsies surgery and medicine. I received top notch medical care. Moms in the Run even paid for my follow up visits including the one at my 6 month checkup that revealed that my breast cancer had spread and was more aggressive. I had surgery the day after Thanksgiving started new medications and went through Radiation. The hardest part through all of this was having to look at the athletes and parents of my cheer gym and tell them that we were closing. The echo of the lights switching off in our once thriving but now empty gym was devastating. Aftr nearly 6 months of being closed of being away from the people I loved the most The depression the guilt and knowing in had let everyone down became too much. I stopped my radiation treatments tried my best to ignore that my hair was falling out and I re opened my gym! I\\'m very excited to say that come this Thanksgiving I will be celebrating 1 year of being cancer free!!! By the graces of God and all the love and spirit that has been neatly packaged in the form of my crazy little cheerleaders with strength and support i found in my amazing family and friends and with the selfless giving of everyone at Moms on the Run I have made it!!! Please celebrate with me by making a donation of any size to Moms on The Run today. + Read MoreUpdate 59 Posted by Danielle Lien 46 months ago Share 1 year down 4 more to go!! They told me the first year would be the most difficult I had no idea just how bad it would be. I had stitches rupture disolve and on one ocassion be ripped out by a tantrum throwing 5 year old who kicked open a car door just as I walked by. I had hot flashes mood swings and my hair started to fall out. I lost \"\"friends\"\" who were scared they would be jinxed by being close to me and they too would \"\"catch\"\" breast cancer. I lost weight from being too sick to eat and then gained weight from the medicines I am taking. And At my 6 month appointment it was discovered that cancer was now growing in my left breast. I was devastated! I made the heart wrenching decision to close my cheer gym. Our athletes and I sat for hours in the dark sitting on the floor of our gym hugging each other and crying. I denied the delivery of our brand new spring floor out of anger only to call a week later and tell the company we bought it from that i had changed my mind....they suspected I would and left it in a storgae unit here in Reno for us. I had to surgery again and this time radiation. Sunburned boobs and armpits really suck. After surgery I got very sick and was hospitalized in the ICU. They thought I was in kidney failure .... but thank God I was okay and able to go home after just a few days. After a long recovery and several rounds of radiation I had had enough. I wanted my life back. I stopped radiation and started feeling better. With the help of some strangers now turned good friends I was able to reopen my cheer gym and my life is nearly back to how it was before. I\\'m celebrating this 1 year milestone with some of the people I love the most and who helped get me through my most difficult days. I am having a sleepover with the kids in the gym tonight and on Sunday I\\'m running in a 10k in memory of my grandfather and for hope for the future of all men and women that there will someday be a cure for Breast cancer available to us all. Thank you Moms on the Run for all you have done for me and the countless people in our community!

I\\'m flying home tonight because my beautiful sweet sister\\'s battle is over. Yesterday afternoon God called her home to Him. She suffered so much over the past two and a half years since her diagnosis and particularly in the months and days leading up to the end that it is a comfort to know she is HEALED and alive with Christ in perfect joy and peace. \"\"So it is with the resurrection of the dead.

If you haven\\'t heard back from her that\\'s why.We\\'ve had to limit her visitors to immediate family because she\\'s so weak and any stress sends her into a coughing fit that last up to half an hour which wears her out even more and upsets her intensely. And when people she hasn\\'t seen in many months or years show up she gets the impression that they\\'re visiting her because they think she\\'s dying and that starts a coughing fit.

His port removal marks the end of this difficult chapter in Matt's life. Many many thanks to all who came alongside him and offered prayers encouragement helping hands and financial donations. Please keep his continued health in your prayers and please consider a final donation to help him pay off his medical expenses so he can truly put this behind him. Thank you!+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Arlene Blackford 12 months ago Share I write this update with a heavy heart. Firstly thank you so much to everyone who has prayed sent encouraging messages and donated to Matthew Skinner's medical bills. In December scans appeared cancer free. There is now an unidentified mass in addition to abnormal blood tests that indicate it may have returned. Matt is scheduled to have chest surgery March 2nd to remove the mass. It is an invasive procedure that includes deflating his lung and he will need to spend some days in the hospital recovering. PLEASE pray for wisdom and steady hands for his doctors and a safe quick pain free recovery for Matt. If you are in the area we are trying to coordinate some meals for him please contact me if you would like to be added to the list. The surgery is a costly five-figure procedure in addition to the cost of staying in the hospital so please consider a donation. Every little bit adds up and is an encouragement to Matt. The past year he had six months of chemotherapy and a serious lung infection. He is juggling multiple jobs being a single dad and trying to get his house on the market. If you know Matt you know he can always make you laugh and bring joy to those around him. Its been amazing to see him continue to do this in spite of one stressful situation after another. Keep him in your thoughts and prayers in the coming weeks. Thanks all.+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Arlene Blackford 14 months ago Share Today was Matthew Skinner's LAST DAY OF CHEMO!!!

It has been a long road but Matt's latest scan shows him to be tumor free! Thank you everyone for the prayers messages and donations. Please continue to keep Matt in your prayers as the debilitating effects of chemotherapy can last several months. Pray for his regained physical and mental strength. Please consider making an end of year donation as we are still far from our goal and a new year means new insurance deductibles. Thanks all.+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Arlene Blackford 15 months ago Share Thanks everyone for prayers and financial support while Matthew Skinner was hospitalized. Happily he was discharged and able to meet his new baby neice. He is home now but still fighting a PCP infection (a rare serious form of pneumonia treated for several days of heavy steroids).

Chemo related or not this girl just can't catch a break! Her pre-existing GI issues and crappy immune system just keep throwing hits. We are going for a second opinion to another cancer center next week. She is obviously in need of a multi-disciplinary team with a different approach.

We got her to her fluid infusion appointment yesterday and they decided she needed to be admitted for dehydration and an abnormally fast heart rate. They are running lot's of tests to check for an infection somewhere in her body because her white blood cells are extremely low (neutropenia). Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers! Please share!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Regina Shirley 18 months ago Share Lex is hanging in there after having undergone her first chemo treatment three weeks ago. Unfortunately she had some very rare side-effects that she is just bouncing back from now...only to go in for her next treatment on Tuesday. They are going to switch up her chemo cocktail and instead of a 4-drug regimen over 16 weeks they will do a 3-drug regimen for 16 weeks then surgery then a 2-drug regimen over 12 weeks followed by radiation. Lex has HER-2 positive Breast Cancer and so this actually allows the doctors to treat her with more aggressive drugs that have been proven to attack such a specific type of cancer. It's been a tough start to this journey but she wants everyone to know how grateful she is for all the love and support and encouraging messages! The support of her entire family and friends near and far are helping her keep a positive attitude. She is going to do everything in her power to fight this! The doctors promised her she would lose all her hair very quickly and after having it almost fall out entirely she gave mom and dad the honor of buzzing the rest off. If you ask me I think she can pull off the Demi Moore GI Jane thing quite well!The doctors also promised her that she should feel strong enough to return to work in small spurts. While she hasn't been able to return just yet she is hopeful as she knows that her dog family at work needs her just as much as she needs them!

       " \"Update 37 Posted by Mary Beth Burgstahler 26 days ago Share Hello everyone! I want to first say thank you for all your sweet messages of concern for Marnie! I’m so sorry I haven’t been updating as frequently but there just hadn’t been much change unfortunately. Still we had an amazing Christmas in California with Marnie and the rest of our family. It was such a blessing to be together. I was able to chat with Marnie this morning. Her latest scan which was conducted in late Dec showed that her cancer was continuing to spread as her CEA levels shot up again. So more chemo and likely the hardcore stuff which will cause her to lose her hair (she’ll still look beautiful). She also had been having severe lung pain. At first the doctors thought it may have been pneumonia but upon visiting with a pulmonologist they are afraid that the cancer could have metastasized to her bones. PLEASE PRAY that isn’t the case because that would not be good. We won’t know until further testing. I don’t know if you follow Marnie on Facebook but you should. This girl is a role model and a source of true inspiration. She has just been living her life to the absolute fullest something that so many of us forget to do until it is too late. This whole grueling roller-coaster of a cancer ride has continued to be really tough for us but we are still remaining hopeful and faithful. We know she is in His hands. Thank you all for your continued prayers thoughts and support. They need it all. I will do my best to keep everyone posted in the coming months. Let’s pray for a miracle! With love and blessingsMB+ Read MoreUpdate 36 Posted by Mary Beth Burgstahler 3 months ago Share Happy Holidays to all of our friends family and gracious supporters. In the spirit of the season I wanted to take the time to share just how thankful we are for each one of you who have been there for Marnie and her family physically spiritually and financially. Each time I write to you I always add “mere words cannot convey the depths of our gratitude.” I write these words because it is true each time. So thank you from the bottom of our hearts. I just spoke with Marnie who is currently receiving her chemo treatment and she informed me that her CEA levels have continued to rise. For those who aren’t aware what this means:A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test is a blood test used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers. ... It may also mean that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.”This is not the news we were hoping for as we enter the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons. While so many will be celebrating festively Marnie will once again be sick and fighting for life. Through tears I am asking for continued prayer and support; any support you can give whether it is financially or simply helping Marnie out with everyday life. I’m forever thankful to a certain family member who gave Jacob Jackson and I the gift of Christmas airplane tickets so we will be able to be with Marnie this Christmas. But in the meantime not being there puts a heavy weight on my heart. So please please please continue to send all the love Marnie’s way. She is strong stronger than ANYONE I know both in her faith and in her fight. But any extra support of any kind is also incredibly appreciated. Wishing all of you a blessed Thanksgiving holiday. Hold your loved ones close. Love and blessingsMB+ Read MoreUpdate 35 Posted by Mary Beth Burgstahler 7 months ago Share Happy July 31st!I wanted to update everyone on the amazing event taking place for which Marnie was awarded the grant!

Given the generosity we have seen and the update on John's health (see below) I've increased the goal. I can't thank you all enough!!Update: After my initial post John traveled to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston TX for another opinion on next steps. Further imaging showed that surgery was not an option for the recurrent tumor (as previously thought) given proximity to blood vessels in the neck. The recommendation was to proceed with chemotherapy. Lindsay and John weighed the options of pursuing treatment in Houston vs. New Orleans very heavily -- ultimately they decided they were most comfortable with transitioning John's care to Houston given the expertise at MD Anderson. He will undergo six weeks of chemotherapy in an attempt to shrink his tumor with hopes that at the end of chemotherapy it will be operable. The next six weeks will be a tremendous challenge with John traveling back and forth to Houston and Lindsay primarily staying in New Orleans.

This past Thursday she had surgery bilateral mastectomy. The good news is that they were able to remove all the cancer.

Her phenomenal daughter Brielle goes with her for each infusion and this last week faced off with one of the infusion nurses who was clearly having a bad day and unfortunately Renate was feeling the negative effects of her bad day.

       " \"Update 7 Posted by Eileen McMullen 14 months ago Share PAGE 2 OF 2Luckily i was leaving two days after the drainage back to new york so i could have it done there if i needed to. So i went home with a home protocol of dieting and 1 month supply of meds/supplements from CHIPSA. I had my brother rent me an oxygen tank for the plane ride home because i became somewhat dependent on oxygen while having the shortness of breath. We ordered the tank through a lovely lady named carol and her business ASHLEY MEDICAL (a private pay company). Luckily we found carol in the san diego area because apparently i dont qualify for an oxygen tank for my insurance to pay for which means that the tank we rented is being paid for out of pocket. Another expense added to all the others. After landing back in new york i went home to see my 3 boys and rest for a few hours after a short nap i still wasnt feeling too good i was having major tightness in my chest and back. Once again on my first day back from the hospital in mexico i found myself in the local emergency room again. I didnt want to go because i just spent 3 1/2 weeks in a hospital in another country and now I was finally home and the same day im back in a brooklyn hospital? After a few test they discovered more fluid had built up in my right lung i knew that it was likely which is why i wanted to have the catheter installed in mexico. They once again drained 2 liters of fluid and i also held out on the catheter but this time only because if i was going to have it installed i wanted it to be by the same surgeon who installed my left drain (because they also saw minor pockets of fluid in the left lung). So if anybody was going to touch the left side i would want it to be the person that did it initially and while there he can also install the right drain. So after stayin under the hospitals care for three days i returned home for a week under the constant care of my family and while being home felt great i still didnt feel as good as i couldve so on christmas day as hard as it was to be away from my kids i checked myself into LUTHERAN hospital to be monitored and given pain medications for the tightness on my chest and aches on my back. While there they discovered yet again (through an xray) that i developed more fluid in my right lung! Now this was going to be the third time id be getting the right side drained. Once in mexico once in the emergency room on my first day back and now a third time a week later at lutheran! I couldnt believe how fast the fluid was accumulating. They drained 1.2 liters and this time i had the drain installed by the surgeon who did the left side. The installed drain not only drains the fluid for the moment but its routine drains also help promote no more fluid to produce as i am starting to see with my left side. In the beginning the left side was releasing 1-2 liters of fluid as well but after the drain was installed it became less and less. I am hoping now that i got the right drain installed we will start to see less fluid as well. Today was actually the first time it was drained manually (4th drain technically but first with the manual drain thats installed not an incision drain which requires being poked every time) and another 1.2 liters of fluid was released!Hopefully over the next week or two the installed drain will help decrease the amount of fluid being built up and i will start to see less like the left side. So to sum it up i currently have two drains installed to drain my lungs (one on each side) and i am currently at lutheran hospital for the past 5 days i am writing this update from the hospital bed. I should be getting discharged in another day or two and i will be getting back on my home protocol from CHIPSA and i will be speaking with my oncologist for more advice but in the meantime i am here because i feel more comfortable under the 24/7 care of the hospital due to anxiety and shortness of breath also they are able to help with my pain. I also had a petscan done which i am awaiting the results for to see my current situation/status and I am nervous. I will be sharing that as well when the news arrives. As you can imagine i am swarmed with thoughts and decisions anything from reaching out with a text message to prayers and even the smallest donation can help. I can sit here and list my expenses but it would just be too much to think of and all it would do is stress me out which is no good for a person trying to heal. Lord knows i want to be there for my kids i want to see them grow old and i want them to see me grow old as well. Any type of support is still support so dont be afraid to brighten someones day with even the most simplest of things. I want to thank everybody who has been helping me and the people who supported me through the toughest of times. I will try my best to update as i proceed through this battle not only for myself but to educate others and to let people know that where there is darkness there is light. Sincerely Eileen.+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Eileen McMullen 14 months ago Share PAGE 1 OF 2Hello everyone i figured i update you about my current situation and my 3 1/2 week stay at CHIPSA hospital in tijuana mexico. CHIPSA was nothing short of pleasant and an awesome learning experience. They got my immune system back up and running within the first week. My initial reason for going was because my biopsy results (from the rash on my back) came back positive for cancer cells I also met two people personally who went to CHIPSA in their worst of times and came out healthy and even went into remission! They do alot of wonderful things there and they really do care. Things that show promise for cancer but the FDA didn't approve here in america (I wonder why?). While at CHIPSA i saw a major improvement in bloodwork and also had a sudden burst of energy. Between their immunotherapies (vaccines) and gerson therapy (strict diet and juicing) i was starting to feel slightly better. While on the diet which consists of no meat (protein) at all i started to retain alot of fluids. They have seen this in patients before being that i was drinking 13 juices a day and having no meat (protein) which helps spread fluids where they need to be. I was getting alot of potatoes as a source of protein but that wasnt cutting it. After the fluid retention they modified my diet and added minor fish and chicken to meals once a day to help spread fluids. In the following week i started feeling more and more out of breath and after talking with the doctor we decided to do a sonogram to make sure there wasnt any fluid in my stomach. It turned out that i was just bloated from all of the vegetable intake between food and juice which wasnt so bad to deal with but while searching with the sonogram they found that i now developed fluid in my right lung! Now this was alarming being that i already had fluid in my left lung which was the origin side of the cancer. Now it being on the right side i cant help but think its starting to spread again. It started with my breast then my left arm lymphedema (after lymph node removal) then my left lung built up fluid then my back (rash) and now fluid in my right lung? Once again how can this be? I was starting to feel good in my mind and body and now another thing is trying to keep me down but i wont let it i refuse to. After discovering the fluid in the right lung i instantly wanted to have it drained i figured if it was drained id feel instant relief from my shortness of breath. We scheduled the drainage and they got out 2 liters of fluid! The doctor said imagine a two liter soda packed in with your organs (which are already compiled as it is) its going to be shifting things around pushing against your lungs and stomach. I definitely felt a major relief in my breathing but unfortunately i wasnt able to have a manual drain installed on my right side like i did my left side (which enables me to drain the fluid on my own whenever i feel some has accumulated) they didnt have the right catheter for the procedure at CHIPSA.+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Eileen McMullen 15 months ago Share VITAMIN C B17 AND K3 IVVitamin C B17 and k3 given through IVHYPERBARIC CHAMBER+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Eileen McMullen 15 months ago Share It's been a while since I've updated and quite a bit has been going on. Since August I have known that I had a pleural effusion (fluid in the lungs) it wasn't causing any symptoms so the hope was that it would go away on its own with my natural treatments. In October I started to feel short of breath and it got to a point where I had to stop every few steps to catch my breath. At the end of October I went to a local emergency room to have 2 liters of fluid drained from my lung. The doctors recommended i have a temporary drain placed until I resolve the fluid issue with my treatment. I underwent this painful surgery and now have a drain attached to my lung on left side until i can minimize fluid. On top of that i developed a painful rash on my back that would also not help shortness of breath and was very very painful. A small biopsy of this rash showed cancer cells. So that brings us to present. I've decided that I needed to take stronger action against my cancer. In my extensive research in the alternative world led me to CHIPSA hospital in tijuana mexico. This hospital has helped many people who were in late stage cancer with their multitude of treatments. Im hoping to find my healing here.I ask that everyone please continue to pray for me and donate if you could. Thank youBaseline therapy is gerson 13 juices!!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Les voy a dar una actualización de la condición medica de mi esposa Natalia Aldana Padilla.Su condición no ha mejorado al contrario ha estado sintiendo los síntomas más seguido el viernes pasado fue llevada de emergencia al hospital por decimatercera ocasión pero nomás le controlaron la presión y la mandaron a la casa pues según dijeron los médicos no pueden hacer nada por ella hasta que se le haga la cirugía. La buena noticia es que el próximo jueves le harán un procedimiento conosido como 'Cardioversión con TEE' esto con la esperanza de que le ayude a calmar las palpitaciones y la alta presión que cada vez son más a menudo mientras sucede la cirugía. Después del procedimiento la vigilarán muy de cerca los médicos por el primer mes para ver cual es su condición si todo sale bien seguirán observandola otros 3 meses y después 6 meses; durante ese tiempo según sea su estado decidirán para cuando será programada la cirugía.Mientras tanto seguimos pidiendo de su ayuda ya sea con sus oraciones compartiendo el enlace de GoFundMe o con algún donativo según sean sus posibilidades.Dios les bendiga y gracias por todo.+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Jesús Padilla 18 months ago Share La condición de mi esposa Natalia sigue siendo delicada.

We were all so hopeful that Chris\\'s cancer was behind him but it\\'s not. After successfully completing chemo radiation to the back and radiation to the lungs Chris was pronounced NEAD - No Evidence of Active Disease. He was able to return to work and start the every three month cycle of tests for re-occurrence. Unfortunately in December the results of his 3-months scans showed that cancerous tumors had returned to both lungs. Chris had lung surgery on Jan. 5 to remove two tumors and a suspicious spot from his right lung. It was confirmed the Ewing\\'s sarcoma has returned. He started a new harder chemo regimen on Jan. 29th. This will go on for about 3 months at least. He will traveling back and forth to Louisville everyday for this chemo and not really sure how harsh the side effects will be. Only time will tell. Also not sure if he\\'ll be able to continue to work. Chris and his family have been so grateful to all that have been able to help. Your thoughts prayers and financial assistance has meant so much. Please keep up the prayers and if you can help Chris with his expenses that would be great! Thank you all for your kindness. + Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Mary Jean Riley 13 months ago Share Chris had his first set of scans done earlier this month to check the process of his treatments. Results show \"\"markedly improved\"\". The tumors in his lungs have shrunk by 2/3 and the tumor on his back has shrunk also. There is no new cancer activity and fewer hot spots. He is in the middle of 30 radiation treatments along with his bi-weekly chemo. The radiation is being focused on the tumor on his back. . This is great news! Many many thanks for all your continued support. He still has a long road ahead of him and a few bumps along the way. One bump was a sinus infection he had last week that delayed his long round of chemo to this week.Keep the prayers coming!! + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Mary Jean Riley 17 months ago Share 11 After a successful visit to Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Chris\\'s diagnosis was reconfirmed and treatments began on Sept. 27th at Kosair\\'s Children\\'s Hospital in Louisville. Chris was also accepted into a clinical trial for some additional chemo treatments. He will be receiving all of his treatments as an inpatient alternating weeks of treatments. The chemo and radiation treatment is very aggressive. Usually there are three weeks between treatments but with Chris there will only be one week. His treatments will last between 12 - 16 months depending on how is body and the cancer react to the treatments.

Beautiful memorial and above all seeing friends from years past and seen friends of Daren Miller that he loved and respected. The stars of the day are the Miller family and Stockton family. The Stockton family is my family and helped financially and were there for us emotionally. My brother from AZ flew right in whom I haven\\'t seen in three years. Daren\\'s family whom I am proud to forever be a part of took control the whole week and made today to most special day that Daren would have been happy to see. They get all credit for that wonderful service. A friend of Daren and I joked for a moment just for one moment that Daren would pop out and say. \"\"Gotcha!\"\" Seeing George George Stone just made me cry because Daren has always loved and respected him. Seeing old neighbors come and pay respects to us was beautiful. Why? Because that\\'s the impression he made on them. 25 years of being with a person seems like a long time but it wasn\\'t. As Darcy Miller said we will ask why. And I do every day. I will never get the answer I want. But it is ok to ask. Every day I talk to him as if he was in the room just to let him know How much he was loved. Dennis C. Miller will have a huge void in his every day life. Because who can come home from work and say even though it was hard work. I got to work with my best friend and brother. Jessie Larson Miller and Paula Silven Miller are my sisters. Not sisters in law. My girls. My friends my confidantes Lisa Norris Wansley Cindy Ghannam Youngs Julie Brownell and Kathleen Campbell you don\\'t even know how big of a part you play. I wouldn\\'t Have met you had it not have been for Daren. Thank you John Davis for sharing your history with Daren. He always called himself \\'the kid\\' and now we know why.

Rosemary and Daren had a very unique element in their marriage that was undeniable...they laughed a lot. It was like they shared a sense of humor. I just thought I would share what I liked best about their marriage.Please continue to pray send positive thoughts and give if you can Rosemary is now a one income provider for Zac and Taylor who would never ask anyone for anything.

Miller 16 months ago Share 11 From Rosemary:Today we said so long to my beloved husband Daren father of two Zac and Taylor. Great brother to Darcy and Dennis Miller and Uncle to Alyssa Hayley Ian Lainey and Jena Miller. Son in law to Rose and Larry Stockton and brother in law to Wayne and Randy Stockton. After spending and optimistic promising day with him on Friday early Saturday morning he took a turn for the worst. The swelling in his brain began to be too much and the doctors worked all they could with all the medicines they could and then wanted to see if another surgery would be an option. After a CT scan showed a massive stroke he was pronounced brain dead. Due to having some minor activity in the brain stem they kept him on the machine all night breathing for him but they had already warned us it could be only hours. He has been surrounded by his entire family from both sides praying for a miracle. The kids and I stayed all night as we couldn\\'t leave our fallen superhero alone just in case. We were told by the doctors this morning that the function is completely gone so the choice was to excavate the breathing tube. But Daren went peacefully in his own with every family member surrounding him. I am thankful that Daren never knew what was going on with himself and thus never knew this would happen. There are no words to express the massive hole in our bodies and our hearts and lives right now. Maybe the things he did Friday that we took for hope was him being able to squeeze us one more time and tell us he loves us. I personally have never felt a pain like this before ever. Our hearts our truly broken. We have missed him so much for the two weeks he has been gone but he is always in our memories. All our love Rosemary Zac and Taylor- [ ]+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 3 Posted by Jessica Attard 48 months ago Share A year ago today was a day that changed my family\\'s lives forever. Last year on March 25th i took Nathan into the ER for his weak and pale appearance. I never imagined what would come from that trip to the hospital that day. On March 26th we spent the entire day giving Nathan blood transfusion after blood transfusion and running multiple tests. On the morning of March 27th the doctors came to speak to us I can vividly remember the doctor telling me \"\"its one of 3 things: leukemia cancer or something unknown\"\". At that moment my heart sank! At seven months pregnant what was supposed to be the happiest time for a mother turned into every mothers worst nightmare. This past year has been an absolute roller coaster for my family. Nathan went through intense chemo-therepy for 9 months. We spent weeks at a time in the hospital. Every 2 months was a new cycle of therapy with new medicines that effected him in different ways. Some medicines made his legs week and made it difficult for him to walk. Keeping up with the neighborhood boys was almost impossible for nate as his legs hurt him to much to run. He was taking a medicine that caused mouth and throat sores which in turn took away his ability to talk and eat. Instead of buying Nathan new clothes like a normal growing boy i wish fishing his smaller clothes out of storage for he was loosing weight drastically. There were medicines that kept him in bed all day with bad headaches and nausea. He took steroids that changed his mood from his normal vibrant self to a child that hated life and everything it had to offer. It brings me to tears just remembering all the pain i watched Nathan go through and how sad he was. But then i look at Nathan today just a short year later and you would never know what he\\'s experienced this past year just from looking at him. It amazes me how resilient children are. I am beyond happy to inform you all that Nathan\\'s blood work is showing 0% leukemia! Nathan now is doing maintenance chemo low dosage chemo to make sure nothing is hiding that wasn\\'t detected. He now only goes into the hospital once a month instead of once a week. Nathan is back in school back in baseball and most importantly back to LIFE! He smiles everyday. He\\'s running with his friends eating the foods he loves and being a normal kid (as normal as can be). I want to thank everyone who has supported Nathan and our family through this difficult journey. You have all made us feel the love and support we needed to get through this time. Im confident that the hardest is behind us. Hopefully as long as everything goes accordingly this time next year i will be announcing that Nathan has reached remission. Please keep Nathan in your prayers and god bless you all!NOW!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Jessica Attard 56 months ago Share Hi friends. I wanted to say thank you again for all your support throughout! Nathan is just finishing his 3rd round of chemo. The doctors said that this round might be a little rough for him with the chemo doubling every week. However I\\'m beyond happy to say that Nathan continues to do better than I have ever imagined! He continues to impress me everyday! Besides loosing his hair here and there neither his behavior nor appearance display those of a sick child. He has not let his sickness get the best of him and lives everyday as normal as possible! When Nathan first got sick people continued to tell me \"\"god only gives you what you can handle\"\". I remember thinking to myself \"\"If that\\'s the case then god must not know me as well as he thought\"\". But god knew he had blessed me with an amazingly strong child and Its Nathan who gives me the strength that I need! I pray that the hardest is behind us and that he continues to not let cancer get the best of him!Please continue to tell nathans story and spread leukemia awareness.~Together we will make it through! Xoxo+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Jessica Attard 59 months ago Share Thank you all for your support! Nathan and I have read all your comments together and I\\'ve truely never seen such a beautiful smile on his face. It\\'s so obvious how important and special you all have made him feel! We have received results from him first round of chemo (called induction phase). From this phase we were told whether the genetics of his leukemia would accept treatment or fight off the chemo. From the bone marrow aspiration he had done last friday the numbers came back to show that after 28 days of intense chemo therapy his leukemia is accepting the treatment. The number of leukemia cells in his bone marrow has decreased significantly!! Yay!!On Tuesday (as long as his counts meet the minimum required for procedure) he will begin his next round of treatment called consolidation.Please continue to spread the word of Nathan\\'s courageous battle.

So I have been dreading seeing my oncologist yet on Dec. 28th I had too :( He really feels my original tumor in my right boob is not shrinking at all and may have even grew a bit :( I have completed over two months of Taxol and yet.....NOTHING. UGH.So based on this fact I go in for a heart test (MUGA) tomorrow to see if my heart is healthy enough to start my dance with the \"\"RED DEVIL\"\" Chemo!!!! Also known as A/C or Doxyl it is red in color and one of the strongest you can get!!!!Please Please pray for me. I have three kids that need me and this is gonna tare me down for about a week or two. You only get it ONCE A MONTH!!!! I have to double flush the toilet after chemo until my pee is no longer RED!!!?? This makes me sick. How can something that messes you up so bad be the only help for this crazy triple negative cancer?!?!On a lighter note Christmas was sooo amazing. I have never felt so loved!!! Riding for the Cure did so much for us and my children that I actually smiled real smiles and cried HAPPY TEARS!!!!!! Then there was the Girl Scouts troop that picked us as their family to donate too!!!!! Thank you all from the bottom of my heart and soul. My kids will never forget any of this!!!!!!! And to see me smile and actually get to relax......AMAZING. We have also been fighting two different bugs here.... Ugh. All I do is sleep it seems. We had a stomach bug then a terrible cold that went straight to the lungs!! I had a fever of 103 almost and had to be put on z-pak for 5 days!! My throat and lungs have never hurt so bad :( Then three kids got it in tip if that!!!!!!! Trying to fight Stage 4 cancer while sick and trying to help three other little people almost killed me!!!!! Then there is the pain. I loathe this pain. I am seriously on enough meds to kill the average person and yet I can barely walk :( My hips and lower back hurt the most and I can\\'t put a ton of weight on them in fear of them giving out and me falling. I can\\'t figure out if being up or laying feels better so I just pop more ibuprofen and pain meds and hope for the best!! I haven\\'t had chemo in over two weeks so I am starting to feel like I did before I ever had any treatment. Like death. Forgot to mention.....I got an MRI and am waiting for the Radiologist report. My oncologist said the good thing he saw was my main \"\"electric cord\"\" of my spine seems to not be getting compressed!!! Yay!Just to make some things clear I still am ever excited to move on to my next destination but it has to be in His timing so while I am here I will try my hardest to make the best of it.....My kids are more understanding than ever......They accept the fact that I can\\'t do every skating party and cook meals daily but Daddy is there and will!!!! They see me in pain and crying cause I can not hide it anymore. I\\'m not that strong and tough. I try and try but have been losing it more often. I hope and pray that they see how much I do try and have tried to be strong but sometimes the towel gets thrown in :( So PLEASE PLEASE PRAY!!! PRAY WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND SOUL THAT I get STRENGTH AND POWER TO OVERCOME THIS DEMON. THIS HIDEOUS DISEASE. I LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU AND CAN FEEL ALL THE LOVE SENT MY WAY. ITS AMAZING.

She had hoped to return home on Friday August 26th. But because of Hurricane Irene her release was delayed until Monday August 29th. She happily returned home that Monday. She has struggled with a minor cold and coughing. She has been issued antibiotics for the problem. She has to return to Richmond once a week for check ups at this time. Her appetite is slowly returning. She is enjoying going for walks and trying to build up her strength. She is trying to follow the many doctors constrictions. She hopes to return to work . But at this time when is still an unknown.Chong gives many thanks to everyone for all their supportcontributionsand prayers. She inspires to get very healthy again soon. She refuses to let anyone down. She wishes everyone the best and hopes everyone is doing well.+ Read MoreUpdate 17 Posted by Brian Olds 80 months ago Share Hi AllThe lovely Ms Pak has progressed enough in her treatment to warrent another update. On 8 August (Monday) 2011 Chong left the VCU hospital and has been only a few blocks away at the hospitality house ever since. Anyone who has talked with her will be able to confirm that she sounds much stronger than she did even one week ago. She returns to the hospital each day to receive doses of potassium and from time to time there are some tests to be run. She reports feeling better and is happy to be able to eat solid food after 3 weeks of liquids. Chong has some concern about a cough that she has been experiencing and will be talking with the doctors about that tomorrow (Friday). Your prayers and support have been extremely helpful to Chong. Although she does not yet know when she will be able to leave Richmond she is looking forward to her return home. Let's continue to keep her in our prayers for rebuilding of her physical strength and for her continued mental and spiritual strength.Thank you to all of you for everything you have done for our dear friend.+ Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Brian Olds 80 months ago Share Chong had her stem cells removed and frozen and she had just started her intense round of chemo. Approximately one week ago her stem cells were reintroduced into her blood stream. As a result of the chemo she has been suffering from diarrhea occasional vomiting an uncomfortable feeling in her throat and a bacterial infection. The doctors suspect the mediport and the catheter could be the cause of the infection so they have removed both. As usual Chong remains in good spirits. She should be released from the hospital to the hospitality house Sunday or Monday. + Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by Brian Olds 81 months ago Share Hello allA quick update to let you all know that Chong has finished receiving her 5 day chemo treatment. It began last Friday 9 July and ended today 13 July. At this point in time she is feeling weak but the pain is minimal. Chong reports that the doctors and nurses are right there with any medication that is needed to keep her comfortable. She is impressed with the staff at MCV and speaks well of the treatment she's been receiving.Thursday 14 July will be a rest day for Chong as the following day (Friday) will be the day her stem cells (that have been frozen for the past 2 weeks) will be returned to her. This process could potentially cause considerable discomfort so please be sure to keep Chong in your prayers and thoughts during this time.The following address can be used if you are planning to send a card in the next week or two.

Christy is the epitome of an awe-inspiring woman with the greatest sense of humor and so much LOVE to continue to give this world...to all of us who know her and strangers alike!After a very successful 8+ hour surgery in May removing much of Christy\\'s colon and also part of her liver (which came after 12 rounds of horrific chemotherapy) Christy and our entire family was celebrating a report of clean scans and ZERO cancer in her body!A couple weeks after surgery...a setback... she got sepsis and ended up in the hospital for a week! She was very sick but as usual  fought through it and rid of the infection in her body.Then for preventative measures Christy was prescribed to undergo a few more rounds of chemo...which she did but not without misery!After only 2 rounds (one month) of the grueling chemo routine she went to the hospital  last Thursday due to minor abdominal pain. Routine exams were done and less than one week ago today...we received the most shocking and devastating news. ...The cancer has returned with a vengeance! There are now 12-20 new spots on her liver and the cancer has also spread to her lungs. She was given a \"\"less than hopeful\"\" prognosis. HOW CAN THIS BE???? Our hearts are aching as we try to swallow the words of her doctors both at Allina and Mayo. Heavy chemo (which she has been doing) is their only recommendation.After seeing what chemo has done to Christy (too nauseous and ill to get out of bed for days on end or hospital stays because her white blood cell count is so low) we are turning to a much more integrative approach!We are feeling Blessed that an integrative cancer center in Chicago is willing and eager to take her on as a patient. She is scheduled for a first appointment on 8/14. They take a more holistic approach to care - they have conventional chemo and also chrono-modulated therapy that is widely done in Europe and is FDA approved yet is the only clinic in the US that is offering it currently.We are hopeful that they will have some new and effective treatments!As you can imagine Christy\\'s current medical expenses are mounting exponentially. Tommy her husband has now also taken leave from work and Christy of course is and has been on leave.This new treatment although somewhat traditional (with some chemotherapy) is covered only minimally with insurance.We are not giving up! Christy is the greatest fighter I know (admittedly kicks my butt) and this new plan gives us the hope we need.Thank God she is feeling healthy right now...hence the pictures taken at our family cabin last weekend. Let\\'s keep her healthy! Please pray above all and if you can donate something to help with this new chapter of her treatment: we believe this will make the difference!Love you all!

Unfortunately her health is declining rapidly and we are operating on a day-by-day basis. This is difficult for our family our family to accept but we understand that the inevitable is approaching. We are using this time for family nights on the front porch as well as eating as many home cooked meals as possible.Sonya has asked me to communicate that she is grateful for all of the calls messages visits and care packages that have been sent. Additionally she would like to acknowledge that she hasn't been able to return some calls/messages but is thankful for the outpouring of love and support. On that note a few packages were returned to the sender due to a mailing error.

From the meals to the visits the movers and painters and everything in between; community is extremely important in times like these. We are grateful for the community (near and far) that has supported us and continues to lift us up even during the final stages of something as heartbreaking as cancer.As my sister has been yearning for home and our family down South the plan moving forward is to get Sonya to Lafayette Louisiana ASAP. Her health is declining rapidly and our goal is to fly Sonya home before she is unable to travel. She will be leaving Worcester within the next couple of weeks. I will drive down some equipment from Massachusetts to Louisiana in order to set up her childhood room as a comfortable resting space. Our hospice team has coordinated with a team in Lafayette and we will be ensuring that Sonya is as comfortable as possible at this extremely difficult stage of the process.While Sonya has known for a while that she wanted to be with family she did not anticipate that she would need to travel so soon. As such she is now in a position of not only trying to complete important tasks before departing but also trying to visit with friends. Unfortunately with so little time it will be difficult to see everyone she desires to see. This part is one of the most emotionally distressing things she is dealing with.Once settled in at home in Louisiana she welcomes visits FaceTime chats or telephone calls and/or mail. With this said it will remain challenging to respond to everyone so she is hopeful that people continue to be patient and understanding. Indeed there are still texts/emails/phone calls she has yet to return.Here is an address for anyone wanting to send wishes letters travel there to visit or do whatever the heart desires at a time like this:520 N.

We are devastated by this news and are disappointed that Sonya will not be able to return to work for the upcoming academic semester; especially because Sonya had been feeling fewer side effects with the immunotherapy treatment. Two days ago she began the final attempt at a curative medical option. Simply put this is a terrifying time for our family and everyone who loves Sonya.

       " '\"Update 8 Posted by Ginger Wilson 12 months ago Share It\\'s strange. I cut his peanut butter sandwich just like I used to (in 4 squares NOT triangles--heaven forbid); I write him a note for his lunch box just like I used to; I throw in some applesauce and snacks knowing the applesauce will get ignored. It\\'s strange because I\\'m also packing anti-nausea meds. A change of clothes incase he has an accident. An epi-pen. It\\'s strange because he has missed almost an entire year of school. It\\'s strange because I love him so much and won\\'t be there to protect his fragile little body as fervently as I have for the past 9 months. It\\'s just strange.Strange but wonderful. London has started maintenance which means 2.5 years of going to the hospital only once a month versus the previous twice a week. He takes daily chemotherapy pills on Tuesday he takes an additional 6 pills and weekly antibiotics. But he can be a kid again. He doesn\\'t have to wear his mask because his counts are in such a range that his body can fight off infections on its own. He can go to school (and will start tomorrow!) He can run and play (as well as he\\'s able...he\\'s still very weak and uncoordinated thanks to the chemo damaging his nerves). He can see his friends again something he has sorely missed. The only drawback is if he does manage to get sick we have to be at the hospital within an hour--and will have to for the next 2.5 years--since he still has the port. The feeding tube is out for the time being as well! To be able to swim at Disney the doctor allowed us to take it out before the trip and keep it out so long as he continues to gain weight. It took a few days to convince him to let me pull the tube out but once I did he could not stop smiling. We both hated that tube. It leaked everywhere. It constantly kinked. But it did its job. London gained three pounds. I know this is a short update after so much silence. London is much happier much healthier (all things considering) and we had a wonderful vacation thanks to my parents. All of your support prayers good thoughts and donations have helped more than any of you could ever know. We wouldn\\'t have made it without all of you and although we are far from done we hope the worst is behind us. Thank you all so much ?+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Ginger Wilson 13 months ago Share 22 Oh the feeding tube....Last week we went into the clinic to get the feeding tube placed. From what I had been told London wouldn\\'t receive any anesthetic they would just thread the tube through his nose and have him drink water to force the tube down into his stomach. The nurse said it would be uncomfortable but that\\'s all... what an understatement. As soon as they placed a towel in London\\'s lap I knew something was up. It\\'s just a feeding tube but I think Josh would agree it was one of the most difficult things to watch. London screamed for half an hour cried and threw up the entire time we were in the clinic. Having a tube in the back of his throat made him gag constantly. He couldn\\'t even talk without vomiting but when he did talk he blamed me for all of it. London proceeded to throw up all day. He refused to talk for a few days as well. His feedings took place at night and surprisingly the first night went really well. However every night after that he wiggled all night not sleeping. Placing a tube that makes him throw up when it\\'s supposed to make him gain weight and stay awake all night when he\\'s supposed to be resting seemed very counterintuitive to me. As it turns out he didn\\'t gain any weight that first week. He actually lost weight. I spoke to the nutritionist who bumped him up to 720 calories a day. She said no one has ever had an issue sleeping while the feedings were happening so we\\'ve currently switched to days. London has slowly started talking more. He enjoys not having to take his medicine by mouth. He can also still eat orally with the feeding tube so doughnuts are a must! He\\'s started vomiting a few times at night now post feeding but we\\'ll figure that out. Most of the food has been digested at that point so I\\'m not terribly worried about the amount of calories he\\'s losing. That\\'s really all the update I have. Thank you all for reading and taking time to keep us in your thoughts and/or prayers. It goes a long way knowing people care and support us during this miserable time. Thank you ?Just left the hospital+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Ginger Wilson 13 months ago Share We\\'re sitting in the clinic right now (actually we\\'re cuddling in the bed under two blankets with an iPad so it isn\\'t all bad!) so this will be a quick update. I just wanted to let everyone know that London will be getting a feeding tube. He\\'s below 40 lbs and with a month of bi weekly chemo left that number just isn\\'t suitable. I\\'ve explained the benefits to him and he\\'s actually okay with this decision. Nutrients will be given at night while he sleeps and he can even take his medication through the tube --which was his major selling point haha. Thank you all for your support!+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Ginger Wilson 14 months ago Share 11 According to London this was his first rainbow. To him it was so beautiful he cried. I haven\\'t been inclined to update because everything I have to say sounds a lot like complaining to me so I figured starting out talking about how tendered-hearted my child is would lighten the post.This third block of treatment has been miserable. It\\'s reminiscent of the first block chemo-wise. It makes London sick tired weepy angry and sullen. The week before Christmas he started steroids again which causes him to cry for hours non stop (literally) scream over small things and refuse to be touched or to speak. Christmas was extremely depressing. You want to see your child enjoy himself normally but especially when he\\'s had such a rough year. We wanted Christmas to be so wonderful he would forget all his troubles for awhile. This wasn\\'t the case at all. Christmas Eve when we opened gifts with my parents he didn\\'t want to sit by anyone he didn\\'t want to talk he opened his presents and then just sat there. I don\\'t think I saw one smile the entire time. As the night wore on he started crying and screaming... not the way you expect Christmas Eve to go. Christmas Day was marginally better with London\\'s dad and I but it still wasn\\'t what London deserved. It broke our hearts.London had a stomach bug last week which really scared me. With a virus they can\\'t give anything so we didn\\'t have to go to the hospital (thankfully because it was snowing). He was in so much pain and so uncomfortable. It was one of the hardest things I\\'ve ever watched and there was nothing to be done but push fluids and wait. He begged to go to the hospital but unless he was dehydrated they said there was nothing they could do. It lasted about 36 hours. We went through all of his underwear and pants an entire container of Lysol wipes and 2 packages of flushable wipes. It\\'s over now though thank goodness. During our last hospital visit we found out London is neutropenic again (no white blood cells so we\\'re house bound). London had also been complaining of back pain so we went for X-rays. Trying to make him get X-rays while on steroids without tears or having \"\"you\\'re the worst Mom!!!\"\" screamed at me is a problem I don\\'t think even Stephen Hawking could solve. He refused to walk to get X-rays (which is on the other side of the hospital on another floor) but wouldn\\'t ride in a wagon so I carried him. Then he wouldn\\'t take his clothes off. Then he wouldn\\'t get on the table. Then he wouldn\\'t lay down. Then he wouldn\\'t hold still. Finally we got it all done after many tears insults screams and a few well placed exasperated sighs from me. London had cried so much his mask was soaking wet and he refused to wear it (but he had to because he had no white blood cells) so we threw his blanket over his head and I carried Michael Jacksons baby all the way back to clinic. Only to find out there was nothing on the X-ray to explain his back pain. Our doctor said it could be nerve damage from the chemo but some good news the pain is currently gone! I\\'ll chalk it up to normal chemo aches and pains and consider that one a win.Steroids are over and London is slowly returning back to normal. Sometimes food still doesn\\'t taste good (one of the side effects) and that combined with the stomach bug had caused him to lose all the weight he\\'s gained. The doctors haven\\'t brought up the feeding tube option though so we\\'ll see if that lasts.Please keep him in your thoughts and/or prayers that he can gain some weight and we\\'ll move into the maintenance phase sometime next month. From what I\\'ve gathered he\\'ll be going once a month for the next 2.5 years but he\\'ll be able to go to school. He\\'ll have to keep the port in which means anytime he gets a fever over the course of those 2.5 years we\\'ll have to get to the hospital within an hour. Although I think the chemo won\\'t affect him as severely as it has been and maybe we can avoid the hospital trips...fingers crossed.Thank you all for your support and for your patience with me not updating. We wouldn\\'t be here without you all and we\\'re so lucky to have so many people care + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

She has been blessed by SO MANY of you donating the past 10 months.

AND it is EXPENSIVE - well over $1000 YES ONE THOUSAND for those 2 weeks.PLEASE share again and again and help her out.SO HAPPY she is surviving and that her immune system has been stable...+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Bob Hagenbuch Jr Composer 11 months ago Share WOW! and . . . HOW???...WOW it\\'s been 6 months.I vividly recall most of the details at NKC hospital on Oct. 5. Some of the worst parts were \"\"We believe Breanna has leukemia\"\" to which I was in instant shock and certain that it couldn\\'t be true that some how her strep throat was just so bad it caused false reading signs of leukemia.I recall both Brea & I on our phones after 10 p.m. as I stayed overnight with her both of us actively researching what it all meant... And after midnight I composed prolifically on a new orchestra work.NONE of us ever expected she\\'d barely survive the next 2 weeks that she\\'d be in KU Medical for 30+ days and that she\\'d endure the past 6 months.HOW does half a year pass and now things are much improved? I could spend hours writing about the trials and trauma and stress (such levels I\\'ve never had in my life). But I\\'ll save it for what Brea composed yesterday. And THANK you to ALL of YOU who did SO many things for us in SO many waysBrea is now in maintenance stage for the next 2 years. But she is SO much better and in recovery & healthy immune system stage now...Here\\'s Brea\\'s post:CANCER UPDATE (sort of...) PLEASE READ!!!Today marks 6 months since diagnosis. On October 5th 2016 I was laying in bed in the ICU at North Kansas City Hospital drugged and in pain exhausted beyond belief... and all the while thinking that my case of strep throat had simply turned into a bad infection that was affecting other parts of my body. I will never forget the moment the doctor came into my room and told me three words that no one ever wants to hear\"\"You have cancer.\"\"I think I said something along the lines of \"\"Okay thank you...\"\" before he left the room. After he did leave I sat there confused and in disbelief a thousand thoughts racing through my mind. I don\\'t remember the entire situation after that. All I remember is my grandma and mom and dad coming over to my bed as I started to hyperventilate and have a panic attack. I thought that my life which I had just started to reestablish was going to be over. I was heartbroken. I was pissed. It was not fair.It is so hard to believe that 6 months has passed and that I\\'ve gone through two blood infections a terrible case of C Diff losing 65 pounds several rounds of intensive chemo several bone marrow biopsies and spinal taps mouth sores laying in bed due to intense migraines and then recovering... and feeling better than I ever thought possible. It has been quite the journey. I am so lucky to have received the care I did from many nurses and doctors at both KU Med and the outpatient cancer treatment center. Without them I would not have survived.I am so fortunate I did not get leukemia when I was younger that I have a young adult\\'s immune system and not that of a developing child. If I had been say 10 years old... I might not have even survived my stay in the hospital. Who knows.Kelly Hagenbuch Bob Hagenbuch Jr Composer Hollis Hagenbuch I\\'m sorry for the several emotional rollercoasters I\\'ve put you through in the past six months. The heartbreak the frustration when you could do nothing to help me because it was just a part of fighting my battle... The anger and impatience when I made dumb decisions. I have taken my life for granted truly. I owe it all to you for being strong for me when I wasn\\'t. For keeping me in line and teaching me that I need to be more respectful and thankful.And so I thank ALL of my friends and family members who have reached out to me since my diagnosis. Your words love prayers good wishes and good vibes and donations to help me pay my hospital bills and doctors fees... I am soooo grateful for ALL of it. I will never be able to repay any of you in the way that you deserve for helping me.

She has a 10 day break in Chemotherapy so hopefully her little body and immune system will have a chance to work on the infection on her leg.

Thank you all for all of your continued prayers and thoughts gifts and letters!+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Cassandra Hill 16 months ago Share Update on our baby girl- Today Danni had her 3rd week of chemotherapy in the induction cycle. Her body has been responding well to treatment but we won\\'t know exactly how well until next week when they go back and do another bone marrow biopsy. Today we did get some great news! Her leg is healing nicely so they have decided to take Danni off IV antibiotics so she can finally take a real bath again! Ha! And her ANC which was only 200 last week has gone up to 2100! This is so great! With her body being able to have somewhat of its own immune system to fight off germs and sicknesses is great! Now I\\'m not sure how \"\"stable\"\" these numbers will be but for now we are excited to just see them up AND she is excited because her doctors said that she can even go Trick or treating! The side effects of the Chemo she is on are really starting to take a toll on her little body. She is retaining water everywhere.... to the point that it\\'s making it harder for her to breath. The doctors say that after we stop these meds that everything will go back to normal. Her hair is really starting to come out now as well she is not ready for this part so we have been having talks trying to prepare her and ease her into it. She gets tired very easily with the occasional aches and pains but considering everything her little body is going through she has been in such great spirits!

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Joann Shihadeh Narowitz 8 months ago Share 11 Hello friends! Karri wanted me to pass along a message to update everyone. This journey of Jakob's has not been easy but he will continue to kick cancer's ass! It has been a while since I have been able to update our go fund me page. We just found out that our team is getting Jakob into a clinical trial out of Los Angeles Children's Hospital. Jakob will have his T Cell genetically altered to be come cancer fighting cells. We are feeling so blessed that our team found this trial for Jakob. This summer will be spent traveling to California and possible having to stay there for 4-6 weeks. Although this is not ideal it is something that has to be done to give Jakob the best chance at a cure. Thank you for all of your support and donations. These donations have helped us so much. We have used this money to pay for medical expenses and deductibles. Please keep praying hard for Jakob and his many doctors who are helping us get him into remission. Thanks so very much for all of your love and support. It is the army of family and friends around us that keep us strong during this fight. If anyone is interested in following Jakob's journey please ask to join #Hwangstrong on Facebook.+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Joann Shihadeh Narowitz 15 months ago Share Thank you to everyone who has been supporting the Hwang family through this unexpected journey. Jakob's fight is going to be a little longer than originally hoped for but in the end we know he will beat this! This is an update Karri wanted to share to let you all know the latest with Jake. If you are able please consider attending a pancake breakfast to benefit the Hwang family tomorrow at Elyria Catholic high school from 8:30-11:30am. Thanks again friends!Yesterday's news was great news. Jakob's tumor has shrunk from over 6 cm to 1 cm. It was so amazing to see what medicine and Jakob's team of Doctors and nurses have accomplished. The doctor did request a biopsy to see what exactly was in the small spot left on his sacrum bone. However the intervention radiologist said it is too risky to try to biopsy that area because the area is where Jakob's nerve roots are. The risk is too great and could cause permanent damage. The official results from the PET scan recommends to add to the the treatment plan to be sure the cancer is all gone. So instead of finishing treatment with round 4 Jakob started round 4 of 7 total treatments yesterday. We had to shift gears a bit and prepare for a little bit longer time period to beat this disease out completely. Jakob had to accept that he won't be able to go back to school until March and I won't be back to work full time until March either. That is ok though because we feel so very positive that Jakob is kicking cancers ass and that this extra treatment will kick it all out of his body!! So this news really just means a little longer of a race to the finish line. We are so humbled by all of your support. We have a big pancake breakfast to attend tomorrow at Elyria Catholic from 8:30am-11:30 am to benefit Jakob. Please stop by if you are interested. Tickets are available at the door. We can't thank everyone enough for taking care of us. The meals donations and prayers of support have been absolutely incredible. Please keep praying for continued complete healing and strength for Jakob. He is officially half way there!!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Joann Shihadeh Narowitz 16 months ago Share Hello friends! Thank you to everyone who has supported the Hwang family through your donations thoughts and prayers. Jakob has been incredible through this and I am personally in awe of his strength and positivity. Karri wanted me to pass along a message to you all since she cannot thank everyone personally:I wanted to take a moment to update this incredible Go Fund me group. Yesterday was day 1 of Jakob's second round of chemo. This time around we were smart and brought in our own freshly laundered sheets blankets and pillows so this would look and feel a little more like home. Last night after he was done with his first bag of Chemo he was off for a walk with his ear buds in and he wanted to be on his own. He has had someone by his side pretty much 24/7 for over the last month. So taking a walk on his own is exactly what he needs and deserves. There are not many 16 yr old boys that spend that much time with their parents. Jakob has continued to show such strength and determination through all of this. He does have his moments of feeling down but he surprises us and is back to his upbeat positive self in no time. We can tell that the mass has shrunk more since his first round of chemo because Jakob is walking much better and his pain is subsiding. This round of chemo will be done on Friday and we hope to be discharged some time Friday or Saturday. Jakob will be half way through treatment when this round is over!! Then he will get to rest at home with the dogs! Elmo and Grover have provided so much love and affection for Jakob while he is at home. I'm truly glad we have them because I see the unconditional love they have for each other even more now. The money this group has raised has been incredible. We will be using it to pay our deductibles for 2016 and2017. It's also a great help since I filed for FMLA and am only working 2 days a week. We feel so blessed to have so many people that care about us. This has deepened our faith and has taught us that God is in everybody. I will send another update beforeJakob starts round 3 of Chemo. Please keep praying for strength and healing for Jakob! We feel the prayers!! Thank you so much for your support!!Love Karri+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Joann Shihadeh Narowitz 17 months ago Share Jakob started chemo last night and is doing great.

Our most natural instinct was to fall on our knees in front of our Heavenly Father but we wanted something tangible we could do to show Trista and Calum that we\\'re fighting with them. We set the first goal at 30K and the site went live while Trista was sitting in her first round of chemo.

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Michelle R Larsen 19 months ago Share We apologize for going so long between updates and we have some tremendous news to share. Almost a year ago we shared our story of infertility and hope for adoption through gofundme. As a result of this post a remarkable woman Claire Saville offered to be a surrogate for us. Because of her selfless offer we investigated the options of surrogacy. After meeting with a lawyer and 2 doctors we discovered that our chances of conception with IVF were similar for us or using a surrogate - both were very high and we were encouraged to try the first transfer without a surrogate. In the past we decided we did not have the funds to try IVF then adoption and we moved forward toward adoption. With good chances and the surprise option of surrogacy we developed the courage to take a risk to try an IVF cycle without a surrogate for the cost of $12000. We are happy to announce it was successful and our baby is due this December. We do understand however that those of you who donated gave generous donations toward adoption not IVF. We have the money in a separate account and are more than happy to return it in a good faith thank you. We appreciate all the financial and emotional support you have given us on this journey and cannot wait to share the story of all of you with our little one one day. Please let us know if you would like the funds returned in the next few weeks. You can email us privately. If we do not hear from you we will be placing the money toward the IVF balance.+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Michelle R Larsen 27 months ago Share Sorry for the lag in an update.

       " '\"Update 61 Posted by Ryan Anderson 9 months ago Share 44 What a difference a year makes! The photo of Lucy on the right was taken this weekend and the well known #LoveForLucy photo to the left was taken a year ago May 2016. At that time Lucy wasn\\'t showing any DIPG symptoms yet and wouldn\\'t be diagnosed until later that year in early August. What a rollercoaster year it has been since for Lucy\\'s family! DIPG has not only changed their lives but it has altered the way they view life. Nothing is taken for granted and the word \"\"normal\"\" seems to no longer find a place in their vocabulary. There is love. There is hope. Their is gratitude. There is fear. There is pain. And there is always change.And recently there have been changes. A few weeks ago an MRI scan showed new tumor growth which was not the news Lucy\\'s family was hoping for. With the resumption of tumor growth minor tumor symptoms are becoming more present. Even with these slowly increasing symptoms Lucy is maintaining her very positive fun and upbeat attitude.Tomorrow May 17 is DIPG Awareness Day. This is significant because there is currently no cure for DIPG and the only way to beat cancer is through awareness funding and a persevering spirit to fight it! Because it is a rare form of cancer DIPG research has been neglected and underfunded. The only way that will change is if there is a growth in public awareness and public advocacy for DIPG research. Please join us in raising awareness!On may 17th please wear a #LoveForLucy shirt or a gray shirt (brain tumor awareness) or a gold shirt (childhood cancer awareness) in support of Lucy and other children with DIPG. And if you do please share why and post your support photo on social media using the hashtag #DefeatDIPG.Thank you so much for your love and support!Also there is now a Facebook page for Lucy at https://www.facebook.com/LoveForLucyDIPG/ . You can visit there for all the latest updates on Lucy and on the fight against DIPG.#LoveForLucy #DefeatDIPG #beatchildhoodcancer+ Read MoreUpdate 60 Posted by Ryan Anderson 16 months ago Share 11 Difficult choices.Life is filled with dilemmas. Cancer and its treatment are even more so. It becomes a difficult calculus of analyzing cost and benefit often times with many mysterious variables and x factors. How does one make choices with so little information? How does one gamble with the life and well-being of a loved one? With cancer there is no other choice. You are forced to make such decisions.As Lucy\\'s radiation treatment came to an end her family was presented with the concept that they had done all they could do. As a parent this is very difficult news to digest. So Paul and Vicky sought out options and second opinions.As a result Lucy has begun a course of chemotherapy. She is on a combination of three chemotherapy medications. One of the medications is taken orally and the other two are taken via IV in 90 minute batches.In my time working at the cancer center at Duke University Hospital I spent countless hours with people in the chemotherapy bay as they received their treatments. These are thoughtful times anxiety-provoking times and often arduous times.In many ways this will be quite different than her radiation treatment. She will have various side effects including nausea fatigue hair thinning or hair loss... many of the hallmarks of cancer treatment that Lucy has not had to face yet.This can be a difficult price to pay. It is even more difficult to pay when the hopes for a positive outcome are so undefined.And yet it allows Lucy and her family a way to continue to fight a way to continue to cultivate hope a way to channel their energy and their desires into actions.Hope always requires sacrifice. And what life requires evolves with time. This is the next step for Lucy and her family. And though it has its associated hardships it is one they take with courage and love. And it is one we will not let them take alone.#loveforlucyLucy gathering strength to press forward+ Read MoreUpdate 59 Posted by Ryan Anderson 16 months ago Share 11 Pieces. We are all made of so many pieces joined together in incredible works of art like living stained glass windows in some ways incredibly resilient and in other ways intensely fragile.When you think about someone you love there are so many pieces of that person--so many facets of who they are--they capture your heart. There is a multitude of things about them that make them who they are from the way their nose crinkles when they smile to the words they use to express their ideas to the way they hold a pencil to the sound of their laughter or the unique cadence of their walk. All of these things are part of the greater whole of a person and whether we realize it or not each of these things becomes precious to us when we love someone.Cancer has a way of punctuating this truth about love and it teaches it in an extremely difficult way: by taking away those pieces a little bit at a time and gradually accelerating the rate at which the pieces slip away. Some of this agonizing attrition is predictable and you try to hold onto those pieces even as you see them starting to slide away. Some of this erosion takes you entirely by surprise and you don\\'t even realize that you are losing that piece until it suddenly and silently vanishes.While Lucy is enjoying the opportunity to attend kindergarten her time there is punctuating the process of some of her pieces coming loose and falling away. Whereas other kindergartners run and jump and climb everywhere Lucy can now barely walk with assistance and has to be carried to traverse even short distances. The time has come for a wheelchair to enter her life.The energy she expends to interact with others throughout the day takes its toll and by the end of the day her speech is now so slow and slurred even her family has difficulty understanding her.When you love someone who is going through this process of losing pieces you feel just as torn apart as they are. Each piece that falls away feels like it has taken a chunk of you along with it and the relentless progression of this evaporation of things you love about the other person leaves you in a fog caught between trying to hold on to the pieces that are left and not having the time to say goodbye or grieve over the pieces that have been lost.You feel like you are falling to pieces. Because you are. And you are just trying to hold it together long enough to be there to be present while there are still pieces of your loved one left. But deep inside of you you have a nagging fear that you are never going to feel whole again that your pieces won\\'t know how to fit together again once this long ordeal has finally come to an end. Your whole life feels like shattered glass in a whirlwind. And as you look at your spouse and your other children you see that they are all feeling it too and all you know how to do is to hunker down and to just hang on to the pieces of your loved ones and of yourself.This storm eventually passes and life finds a way to heal and rebuild. But at times like this it doesn\\'t feel like that will ever happen. In times like this all you can feel are pieces.#loveforlucy+ Read MoreUpdate 58 Posted by Ryan Anderson 17 months ago Share 33 This last week was so full of activity for Lucy there\\'s no way I can do it justice with a single update. So I\\'ll try to share some of the highlights over a series of updates.After finishing up her radiation treatment Lucy and her family began a whirlwind tour to visit family friends and supporters. Their travels on Thursday took them to the BYU Bookstore in Provo Utah where Lucy had the ability to meet the amazing people who made her wish for a lucky green BYU hat come true.This was compelling and precious full circle moment. Only a handful of weeks ago I sent out a plea to the world in general for someone to help us forge the emotional armor that Lucy would wear as she faced the rigors of radiation therapy and the uncertainty she would find on the far end of treatment. Many people responded with suggestions connections were made and a few very determined individuals recognized they had the power to make something happen and so they went about turning a childhood desire into reality. This small act has become a story that has touched the hearts and moved the souls of tens of thousands of people. This relatively simple action has planted a seed deep within many of us and has gently challenged us to be true to our better natures.Lucy\\'s green hat is so much more than just an accessory. It is an embodiment of love the one thing that can heal us all even when there is no physical healing to be had. It is a symbol of the connection that we have as human beings the responsibility each of us has for the others. It is a manifestation of something far stronger within us than all of the pettiness that we allow to divide us. As my sister-in-law Ruth stated sometimes humans get it right. Lucy\\'s hat is made up of all those moments of humans \"\"getting it right\"\" in microcosm given a form that even a child can understand.Perhaps all of these concepts are more than Lucy can understand and take in. But in those moments surrounded by her BYU Bookstore friends and fans Lucy could feel these truths even if her five year old vocabulary lacks the means to articulate them. My nearly 38 year old vocabulary struggles with the same task and yet here I am trying to capture the essence of the experience with mere words. It doesn\\'t do it justice. But this is what I have to offer and therefore this is what I will give.The meeting in the BYU Bookstore that day will never be forgotten by any who participated in it. It is my hope that the thoughts feelings and commitments that the story of Lucy\\'s green hat has inspired in all of us will remain with us like an inscription upon our hearts and they will lead us to reach out to not wait for someone else to be the solution to the human suffering we encounter but to ask ourselves \"\"What can I do?\"\" and then have the courage to do it whether it seems too big to manage or whether it seems too small to matter.No suffering is so small that it should be born alone. No suffering is too great that it can\\'t be faced together.#loveforlucyA choice meeting.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 20 Posted by Melissa Loving-Dahl 45 months ago Share Check-upBy Melissa Dahl — Just wanted to let you all know that today I had my 1st mammogram since I became cancer free and everything came back all clear! They were able to check my scar and the doctor used a medical term for the scar not flattening. If I decide to they could fix it. But I am not sure that I really care. It is always covered and I don\\'t think that it is worth the hassle. Also I found out today that science has improved over the last year and there is a new gene test that I could have done. It is called the BROCA test. But insurance doesn\\'t cover it yet so we are going to wait until my insurance covers it to see where my cancer could have come from. We have so much to celebrate this year and continue to count all our blessings every day. Thank you all for your continued support and prayers!! + Read MoreUpdate 19 Posted by Melissa Loving-Dahl 51 months ago Share So Very Thankful!!!We hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving and spent it with family and friends. I spent the day between the couch and the bed recovering from surgery. Ryan has been a great nurse. Along with my sister Lindsey mom dad and mother-in-law. It has been very hard not being able to pick Jacob up so we have been relying on all of our family to help take care of him.I have about a 6in scar on my left breast and the same scar where my port was. The port was taken out during surgery. The most painful part of recovery has been my armpit which I expected. It\\'s amazing how many muscles are under your arm!!We received the most wonderful news yesterday. All of the margins from the tumor came back negative for cancer and my lymph nodes were also clear of cancer. So ALL of the cancer is out of my body!! I will talk with the doctors next week but assume radiation will still last 6 weeks starting in January. So if all goes according to plan this should all be over in February!!Jacob also had his 8 week doctors appointment this week. He is now a whopping 7 lbs 8 oz and he still is not to his due date!! He will be two months old on Wednesday which also just happens to be his due date. We found out that he has a hernia that needs to surgically fixed. We have an appointment for him this week too so the doctors can figure out a course of action for this. Thank you for all your prayers!! We are very thankful for all of you!+ Read MoreUpdate 18 Posted by Melissa Loving-Dahl 52 months ago Share Here is the latest from Ryan and Melissa\\'s caringbridge site.....Well...what a whirlwind of a week. Last Friday a nurse told us that Jacob was dong so well that he could be going home soon. The doctor then called us and told us if Jacob was a \"\"model citizen\"\" he could go home on Sunday 11/3.We did not want to get our hopes up because we knew of two different sets of parents that were given a discharge day and something happened and they were there for much longer. Jacob then decided to not gain weight on Friday night so the date was pushed back to Monday.Before parents go home from the Swedish NICU they have to \"\"room in\"\" with their baby. We were able to stay for the first time all night with Jacob!!!! We were both nervous because Sunday night he didn\\'t gain weight again!!! He also had a little \"\"event\"\" during his feeding. It was up to the doctor Monday morning to decide if we could take Jacob home with us. After a very long night of worrying the doctor finally came in on Monday morning and told us that we could take Jacob HOME!!! We were so relieved!! As soon as he was all unhooked from the wires we finally felt that we could tell people! We have been so happy to be able to snuggle him whenever we want and to not have to drive back and forth to Seattle everyday!!Another big milestone was accomplished this week. I had my LAST chemo infusion on Thursday!! Exactly 6 months to the day after I was diagnosed with cancer. Back in May the end of chemo seemed so far away and it is such a relief knowing that the 1st phase of my treatment is now over!I want to thank everyone for all their support during chemo. Especially my Mom who only missed ONE chemo treatment in the past 6 months. I also want to thank my Grandma and Grandpa Rob (Avis and Garland) for making us dinners every Thursday during my treatment!! http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/melissadahl+ Read MoreUpdate 17 Posted by Melissa Loving-Dahl 52 months ago Share Here is the latest from Ryan and Melissa\\'s caringbridge site.....Jacob is holding his own. Yesterday he decided to give us all a Halloween trick and he pulled out his feeding tube. He definitely already has a mind of his own! He is now getting all of his feedings from a bottle so the tube will not go in until he needs it again. He is now 5 lbs 3 oz! Some of his premie clothes are a little too snug for him! He is still having \"\"events.\"\" He cannot go home until he has 5 days in a row with no events! The doctors all say this is normal with premies and he will eventually stop. It is hard to believe that Jacob is almost a month old. This has been the longest month ever for us! Traveling back and forth to Seattle has been really difficult but we appreciate all of the people who have taken care of Macie (the dog) and our house and yard. I had my 11th taxol infusion yesterday. My 12th and final infusion will be next Thursday the 7th. My doctors added one onto the end because I didn\\'t get chemo the day my water broke. My surgery is scheduled for November 26th. (The Tuesday before Thanksgiving.) Then I will have radiation starting in January and lasting until the end of February. We want to thank everyone for your support during this difficult time. Please pray that Jacob is able to stop having events so we can take him HOME!!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

The tumor seems to be completely gone and her lymph nodes are still swollen. She will have an ultrasound completed before she does her 4th round so they can check her progress. Her double mastectomy is scheduled for May 18. Her 2nd round was tough because she caught a cold from the kids and with her immune system being down it took her longer to recover. Also last Sunday the flu hit her house so she had to seclude herself from everyone because if she were to catch it she would be hospitalized. Luckily she didn't get it!

The first round made her pretty sick for a little more than a week and she had a difficult time getting out of bed. This past week she has been feeling pretty good so hopefully it doesn't get worse as she gets further along.

Monday she had her port put in her chest which is causing her alot of pain. She is starting Chemo on Thursday and will be doing chemo for 18 weeks. She had her lymph nodes biopsied and they tested positive so the cancer is aggressive and spreading so we are hoping the chemo will stop it from spreading and completely kill the cancer in her lymph nodes. If the chemo doesn't do that they will have to remove them during the surgery. Thank you so much for everyone's donations so far. Tiffany Jason and the boys appreciate it so much! Any little bit helps because she has been having so many appointments for the past month and is being treated at Delnor and CDH so it's a bit of a drive for her.

There are multiple things happening all at once with just as many unanswered questions. I'm going to do my best to explain and cover everything that is going on. First let's talk about the amazing Make-A-Wish that was granted for Chloe! She got to meet Russell Wilson and Ciara she also received an autographed jersey and football. The entire family was also able to attend a Seattle Seahawks game in their own suite. Thank you Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Children’s! We are 12 go Hawks!! The last few weeks have been bit of a rollercoaster ride with lots of highs lows and multiple tests. Chloe is continuing to fight but there have been some changes and the doctors are concerned. They have been running multiple tests and scans including blood work x-rays scans and MRI's. Here is a breakdown of what is currently going on and what we know so far. • Although recent tests have shown no new cancer Chloe has been moved back to the cancer floor and is no longer receiving rehab right now. The team on the cancer floor is able to provide the care that she needs right now. • Chloe is receiving a very high dose of steroids but she can only remain on this dosage for a couple more weeks. The steroids are keeping her going yet causing other problems along the way. • Her blood work is showing that her bone marrow is failing to produce cells properly. That includes platelets hemoglobin red & white cells. Steroids are most likely not the cause of her immune system crash but they don't know what is causing it. Chloe has received multiple transfusions to keep her levels in a normal range and it sounds like the transfusions will continue. • The chest x-rays showed that her lungs are clear and there are no blockages of her airway passages. • The MRI yesterday showed that the necrosis is continuing its path.

       " '\"Update 3 Posted by Jonathan Minner 54 months ago Share Earlier this week we visited Sarah Canon Cancer Center to discuss the upcoming treatment. The prognosis was good I\\'m in good physical and mental shape and I have the support from my family and Bethany to take care of me and bring me back and forth to the Center in Nashville. The only issue is that I have no insurance. My school insurance ended on the first day of the new school year and it was payed out the maximum amount with treatment I received in Sarasota. I was denied my initial attempt to get Social Security Disability which would allow me to get TennAssist or Medicaid or whatever they call it. They said that my Type 4 Lymphoma wouldn\\'t disable me for a year a message I received while in bed with debilitating pain and lack of energy.We re-applied for Disability as soon as I was diagnosed with re-emergent Non-Hodgkin\\'s Burkett\\'s Lymphoma . With some advice we used a special code to help the reapplication process and speed it along and when we called that day they had received the letter but it hadn\\'t been entered into their system. The gentleman we talked to on the phone offered to start the process but he also said that it would take 30-90 days to go through the system. The problem is that the Sarah Canon Cancer Center will not start ANY treatment unless I have some kind of insurance and we can\\'t wait for Social Security Disability to kick in normally. We managed to get some of the tests they have to perform switched over to William Medical Center but the deadline is fast approaching for me to undergo my 4th round of chemotherapy at Sarah Canon for them to harvest my stem cells for treatment. Even then the medical assistance through disability won\\'t cover the treatment which is why I started this fundraiser.+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Jonathan Minner 54 months ago Share Today I was woken up at 8:07 by a phone call from one of the debt collectors. I\\'ve talked with them about my situation but they still keep calling. The worst part is when they call at 8 in the morning or 10 at night especially on the weekends. It is an automated message that will get you in touch with a live person during business hours. The problem is it doesn\\'t call during business hours! It does says \"\"Sorry\"\" and disconnects if you try and reach someone alive.On a much better note Bethany her mom Monica and her Aunt Ceewee and our dog Lindy will be here within a few hours. I\\'m very excited to be back with my girlfriend after being gone for weeks.Thanks Liz for donating! Every bit helps not to say $100 is a bit that\\'s like almost a month of groceries from Sam\\'s Club.+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Jonathan Minner 54 months ago Share Things have been crazy the last few months. I successfully finished my 6 months of chemo and the cancer went into remission. I moved back to Sarasota FL in order to go back to school to attempt to finish my senior year and get my degree in Computer Animation. Unfortunatelyabout a month and a half later I started getting pain in my knee and thigh and I thought it was simply my attempts at walking and getting my strength back. It wasn\\'t until I had multiple areas \"\"pulled\"\" and \"\"strained\"\" after a lovely trip to Ohio with Bethany for her cousin\\'s wedding reception that I figured something was wrong. My platelets tanked within a few days and during the first week of school and a bone-marrow biopsy later I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\\'s Burkett\\'s Lymphoma once more.I was in agony everywhere. I was told that it was because my bone marrow was expanding as the cancer underwent rampant growth and I was feeling the pain of my bones swelling.I\\'m back in Tennessee now and I\\'ve undergone 2 chemo treatments so far. The pain overall has gone but my knees are still incredibly weak and sore. The plan is to perform 3 chemo treatments put the cancer back into remission and if successful undergo stem cell therapy and isolation for a month.I go to Sarah Canon Tuesday for my first appointment. And I\\'ll be trying to update this regularly as time progresses.

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Erica Butler 1 month ago Share 22 The last few weeks have been particularly rough for our family but we are so appreciative of all of the support we have received. After quietly grieving together we are now prepared to face this head on and ready to share the “not so fun” details of my cancer. After experiencing consistent pain in my right cheekbone I alarmed my care team and received an immediate Brain MRI the day after Christmas. The news was not good. A tumor had started growing in my cheek bone and was now invading the soft tissue of my cheek. I was in a lot of pain and immediately referred to a radiation oncologist at UW who specialized in tumors of the cranium brain and spine. I also had additional imaging done that indicated the cancer had now spread to my bones both lungs and several lymph nodes throughout my body. I started immediate radiation therapy to my face and just completed this treatment on Thursday. Although I’m extremely swollen my pain is less and I’m feeling better everyday. I almost feel like I’m in the twilight zone where the doctors are showing me pictures of the cancer in my body but I keep thinking “that can’t be me I don’t feel sick!” The question I keep getting is “How does this happen? You have Breast Cancer.” Well we’ve known from day one that I had a very aggressive subtype of breast cancer called Triple Negative where there are few targeted or effective treatment options compared to other types of breast cancer. We knew mine was particularly aggressive since my tumor continued to grow through 5 different chemotherapy drugs. This is not a typical response to chemo but we know now that I have several mutations that seem to be chemo resistant.Because of this I had continued treatment at the hopes of preventing a reoccurrence. Cancer cells from my breast were shed into my bloodstream and are now taking root in other areas of my body. This is now called Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer and it is terminal. There is no cure for me. Because of the few effective treatment options available the average life expectancy is 13 months. Living beyond 2 years is actually considered pretty remarkable for Metastatic TNBC. We are completely heartbroken by this news and have spent the last few weeks devastated sad angry...but getting back to hopeful. We are determined to not sit in this sadness any longer and intend on spending the rest of our time together enjoying our beautiful life with our amazing little boys. Through the tears there has also been a lot of love joy and laughter and an overall deep appreciation of each other and our boys as well as our family and friends. We know we are so loved and thank you all for that!!I have access to and will continue to receive some of the best treatment options available for TNBC through UW’s Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and Fred Hutchinson Research Center. I hope to extend my journey as long as possible and fight as hard as I can. I am currently receiving Keytruda an immunotherapy drug that has had some success at stabilizing metastasis in TNBC. It is too soon to tell but we are hoping it is doing its job. I am also on standby to enroll in one of the most fascinating and promising trials for Stage 4 TNBC in the nation called CAR-T Cell Therapy. CAR-T Cell Therapy has shown extreme success with blood cancers. The trial is now expanded to TNBC solid tumors. It is the only one of its kind in the nation and I am extremely fortunate that it is based in Seattle and that my oncologist is heading the trial. I have an amazing care team who is doing everything in their power to get me the best treatment possible. This is definitely not the update I wanted to give but we are so incredibly thankful for everyone’s love and support. Throughout this journey I hope to raise awareness about Triple Negative Breast Cancer and encourage others to do the same.

Cale David weighed in at 8.1 pounds and is 20.5 inches long. He is a very content baby and strong and healthy!After delivering Cale Kendall was able to have all of the scans she could not have before because of her pregnancy. The scans confirmed that the cancer remains contained to her breast. However the tumor has grown and she is now at Stage 3 because of the size of the tumor. Kendall's oncologist explained that even though she received the same dose of chemotherapy as a non-pregnant woman the effectiveness may have been reduced because of the pregnancy...there is just no way of knowing. We are very thankful that the A/C chemo kept the cancer from spreading and Cale was born full-term and healthy. Kendall is now receiving weekly Taxol/Carboplatin chemotherapy and is scheduled for 11 more treatments before surgery and five weeks of daily radiation. Kendall's genetic testing did confirm that she has no hereditary predisposition to cancer. We have no idea where this beast came from and why Kendall has to be fighting it when she should be able to just enjoy raising her boys and building her career. We do know that she will continue to fight and will beat this down so that she can be that beacon of hope for other breast cancer victims in the future. We sincerely thank you all for your generous donations. We are truly blessed to have so many people...family friends and even people we do not know that care about Kendall and her fight. Please continue to pray for us and send warm healing energy to Kendall.

       " '\"Update 15 Posted by Keegan Albright 3 months ago Share Hey everyone. Hope all is well and everyone is getting ready for the holiday season. We’ve got another update regarding our Snappy boy. I believe I never got around to updating on our last vet visit so let me begin with that. Snap’s October check-up revealed a few new things. His tumor had only grown by 0.1cm which was great news. However his blood tests showed some increases in levels of certain compounds in his kidneys which warranted a change in treatment. We discontinued the anti-inflammatory he was on since these medications are known to potentially cause kidney issues among other things. He’s still taking the low-dose chemotherapy medication and immunity supplement. So that was October’s vet visit. We had another visit this morning with the usual tests and procedure. The good news is that Snap’s kidneys seem to have improved since October. Still slightly higher than normal levels but significantly decreased since last month. Also Snap is still his typical happy-go-lucky self! However we did get some not-so-great news this morning as well. The tumor has grown by 0.4cm since October. This is a 4x increase compared to the September-October growth. There are still no signs of effusion into the pericardium or any other abnormal fluid accumulation anywhere else so these are good signs. We knew that we couldn’t completely stop the tumor and it would eventually start to grow again no matter what we did. All that matters to us is if Snap is happy and capable. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again as long as he is happy and capable of his daily activities we will continue doing everything we can for him. He never gave up on me so I’ll be damned if I give up on him. I’m so thankful to have been given all of this time with Snap thanks to so many. Happy birthday Marines. Semper Fi.+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Keegan Albright 5 months ago Share Update time! First I would like to start off with good news. Snap had chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound done over the last week. The idea was to check for metastasis of tumors as these tumors frequently spread to the lungs and/or spleen. Snap was all clear in all areas other than the known tumor on his heart! Our Snappy boy has truly shown his warrior spirit this year and we were so relieved to know that it appears as though the cancer has not progressed much. Our oncologist sounded very proud on the phone and said that \"\"we were kind of in uncharted territory\"\" as far as Snap\\'s continued treatment options go. This is because Snap has surpassed the average maximum life expectancy post-diagnosis of HSA by two months at this point! We have a nightly routine now that consists of me returning home from classes slicing up a cucumber and giving Snap cucumber slices throughout the evening. A dog that loves cucumbers... I know it sounds weird. Snap is not usually a huge fan of actually chewing his food (he\\'s a Lab after all) but he makes damned sure to chew his cucumber slices and savor the flavor! As far as continued treatment goes we\\'ve decided for now after consulting his oncologist that what we are doing must be working given the recent findings. So we\\'re going to continue with the current meds and supplements with a monthly recheck of his heart to monitor the tumor there. If anything else comes up we will do our best to deal with it accordingly. ANOTHER MENTIONABLE MILESTONE: Snap had his OFFICIAL 11th birthday this past Saturday. As we were rummaging through his records we discovered one document that listed his birthday as September 16 2006 in a small box in the top right corner of the document. Somehow I had missed this over the years. Bad dad . So we celebrated by taking Snapperdoo to his favorite dog park w/ swimming hole and he swam after dozens of tennis balls for over an hour. Although I doubt this was even his favorite part of the day. When we got home we had a surprise for him waiting in the fridge. (and his knucklehead brother so he didn\\'t feel left out) We cooked Snap and Cash each a lean cut of steak for Snap\\'s birthday. Snap also got a side of cucumber slices. He couldn\\'t have been happier. We can\\'t say enough how much we appreciate those who have helped us to get to this point and how much it meant to us to be able to celebrate Snap\\'s 11th year of making this world a better place. Here are some photos from Saturday.+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Keegan Albright 6 months ago Share Hello again everyone. Snap has made it through the summer and we are back to the grind at school again! Snap continues to show that he is still capable and we\\'ve been swimming a bit since getting back to St. Louis. He is definitely still a happy dog and still enjoys chasing his soccer ball down the hallway. Snap also just had his 11th birthday! He was seen yesterday by his team of veterinarians and they were able to locate the tumor once again. It has grown slightly since the last time they were able to observe it. His oncologist has suggested he get additional xrays and ultrasounds to check for metastasis and we may form a new treatment plan depending on those results. We are still waiting on xray results and an appointment next week to get his abdominal ultrasound done and are likely to be incurring some new expenses regarding his treatment. Until Snap shows us that he is ready to go then we plan to continue treatment as long as his quality of life and function doesn\\'t decrease. We\\'ve nearly exhausted the funds from this GoFundMe on his treatment up to this point and again would like to extend the invitation for anyone who is willing to donate towards his care. We of course appreciate any and all support and will never forget how you all helped make it possible for Snap to be with us today.+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Keegan Albright 8 months ago Share Quick update. We are now over five months since Snap\\'s initial diagnosis of hemangiosarcoma (HSA). Snap is showing no signs of slowing down and is as happy-go-lucky as ever. He\\'s maintaining a healthy weight and seems to still have the same energy level he\\'s had over the last year or so. He has been on a low-dose chemo capsule and anti-inflammatory each 3-4x per week. A webinar we watched a while back stated that if your dog with HSA makes it a year past initial diagnosis then it is likely that the HSA will not be fatal. As much resolve as our Snappy boy has shown these past few months we have no reason to believe that he won\\'t make it another year! He still begs everyone for their last piece of bacon or the microscopic morsels of potatoes left on the plate. Cash Snap\\'s little Doberman brother does well to keep Snap active and get his exercise in. I couldn\\'t be more proud of Snap and his resilience not only since January but since I met him back in 2010. This year has certainly tested him but like usual Snap has overcome these obstacles and bounced back like it was no big deal. Would like to thank Colleen and my parents for all of their assistance with Snap and keeping him up on his meds on my work days. Snap has such an outstanding support system and cheerleading section around him.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 4 Posted by Bethany McAnneny 56 months ago Share An Unimaginable \"\"Thank you!\"\"This fundraising endeavor has provided us with an experience that not only seems to exceed our expectations but almost questions reality. Within less than week we were able to surpass our original goal of $10000. This incredible launch of \"\"crowd funding\"\"\\x9d left the news world impressed with our efforts! Just this past Monday Kaet was featured on Fox Business\\' Varney & Company for an interview regarding this actual fundraiser and our experience (check out the link below!) Also Kaet still experiences unforeseen obstacles such as a 4th additional impromptu surgery just this week. In addition to steadily increasing medical bills and the unpredictability of this disease money will Kaet and Brian to adjust when chemo treatments begin and employment is decreased...up next wig shopping! It is so important to Kaet Brian and our family for everyone to truly understand how thankful we are for everyone\\'s efforts. This is a tough time but the gifts of hundreds of selfless people are truly helping make this transition as smooth and tranquil as possible. From our family to yours: Thank you! http://www.foxbusiness.com/on-air/varney-co/index.html#http://video.foxnews.com/v/2546524035001/couples-turning-to-crowdfunding-for-babies/?playlist_id=87060+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Bethany McAnneny 56 months ago Share Thanks for all of the support. The actual bills are starting to roll in now and they are higher than expected. Kaet\\'s lab fees were only supposed to be $1500 but they ended up being $3100. We have still yet to receive the rest of them. We love all the the thoughts and prayer messages we are receiving and will continue to keep the site running and up our goal as need be. Its hard to know exactly how much some of these things will cost but its great to know the love is there :)+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Bethany McAnneny 57 months ago Share we\\'ve reached our overall goal but will keep open it up for anyone who still feels inclined to donate. Kaet might be in and out of work for a while and other bills will arise but in about 10-12 days they get to make some frozen babies and its all because of you!!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Bethany McAnneny 57 months ago Share So close to our goal! thank you so much! We had to raise it a little bit to cover the 8% fee from the website but whats most important is that Kaet & Brian will have the money they need to pay upfront for the embryo freezing!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 3 Posted by Kris Ten 7 months ago Share I want to update everyone who has been following us on our journey. As you know with your generous contributions we were able to test our embryos and were blessed with 3 genetically perfect embryos to choose from. We were adamant that we not know the gender of the baby so we let Gianna pick! She chose lucky number 2...what that means...only time will tell! We transfer that little embryo next Friday and will find out on her birthday if it worked. My only request is that you respect my decision to wait to reveal if it worked on my own time. After losing a baby it's very hard to share the news until all is 100% well. So stay patient and keep the prayers coming! Thank you all again for your amazing support along this roller coaster. You have made the ride incredibly smooth for all of us. #hope #dream #nevergiveup+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Kris Ten 10 months ago Share In honor of national infertility week I am excited to share the exciting news of phase 2 of our journey. We had tremendous success with the retrieval of 17 eggs. About half of those eggs fertilized and made it to genetic testing. We received our results and we have three perfect embryos that we can transfer! (We can only do one at a time because of an issue I have with my uterus.) Our plan is to transfer one this summer when school is over. My doctor is very excited because we have never been in such a great position before. Ironically the embryos that are perfect are not the ones that appear perfect. Therefore without all of your help and support we may have spent many months perhaps years transferring embryos that would have never brought us a baby. With your kindness and support we may be able to have success on our first attempt this summer since we now know which ones to transfer. I cannot express to you how grateful I am for all of your support. You all have put us in the best position to completing our family and for that I am forever grateful. I will continue to keep you updated and I appreciate you following us on this journey. I pray to have good news to share with everyone come fall of next year and in the meantime I will continue to pay forward the kindness you all have shown to me. I thank God for blessing me with the most amazing people in my life!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Kris Ten 12 months ago Share Michael and I have met with the financial advisors at our fertility clinic and have discussed every possible scenario at length. The one that will most likely bring us the best results is to do two egg retrievals one at the end of this month and one in June. An egg retrieval means I will take medication in the form of shots for a couple weeks. During this time the ovaries will develop multiple eggs rather than the one they normally do every month. At the end of the two weeks I will have surgery (retrieval) to remove the eggs. Our hope is to get as many as possible! Once we have done this twice we will transfer the embryo that comes back from the genetic testing as healthy. Hopefully this will be the last time we will ever have to do this. I pray! So with the help of our family and friends we have raised a little over half the total cost. We are beyond thankful for all of your help and support. If you saw me in person to thank you you know I can hardly do it without crying. It means more to us than I can put into words. I want to update everyone because I feel you have invested time and money in our story and you deserve to know what is going on. I want to thank everyone again for being part of our dream. As much as I love my family at my fertility center I hope that after this summer I will only be seeing them at the celebration of life picnics!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I keep thinking maybe it has gone away because unlike a broken leg or injury cancer cannot be seen especially since no treatments have been done.It seem so strange to say Chris has the \"\"C\"\" word because he looks and acts so healthy but I know the mental game can be a tough one to handle too for all us.God has really blessed us both on this journey and I pray that it will be over sooner than later.Chris is such a quiet and private man and I know I am making him crazy worrying about him all the time.

       " '\"Update 11 Posted by Hawk Harrison 55 months ago Share 33 So I feel like it\\'s been forever since I have really written a post with any content. I\\'ve just been going like crazy since school (my job because I teach elementary art) started back. My first day was Monday and the kids first day was today. I was so rusty horrible time management cracking voice rambling instructions. Oh well I know I will get back in the groove quick enough. I\\'ll try to hit the highlights of the past few days. Sunday Hawk was in the church nursery by himself for the first time! He was sleeping and off food so I figured he would be ok and of course he was. They held him the whole time and when he woke up they played patty cake and tried to get him to say \"\"mama\"\". Monday Hawk had PT and I think I already posted about that a little but the PT was impressed with his standing. Hawk is really loving to stand these days and is getting much better. He still needs strong trunk support for balance and can only lift his head for a second but he is holding his full weight. The best part is that he wants to stand up and he communicates that to me by wiggling and stretching out his legs and grumbling. He is communicating in other new ways also! He\\'s starting to smack when he\\'s hungry grumble when he wants to change positions or he\\'s cold smiling more talking some at random times (not just during play) and his face is VERY expressive when I feed him tart foods. He much prefers bland veggies cereal or sweet things. I mentioned Hawk had Lekotek play therapy on Tuesday already in a post but I did not get the picture up and I\\'m sorry for that but I will do that tonight after this post. The picture is on my phone and I\\'m typing from the computer right now. The lady from Georgia Pines vision therapy came out for the second time on Wednesday. Most of her time was spent asking assessment questions but she did give us a few things to work on. She suggested playing peek-a-boo with toys and seeing if he notices that they disappear and reappear. She also printed out some bull\\'s eye and checker board patterns for us to see if he was attracted to the high contrast. I had already read that babies like high contrast and had worked with him some using a baby stimulation app on my iPhone. And she suggested playing games where you take turns (like I clap his hands then my hands then wait to see if he will try to clap) which is what I was doing when she suggested playing games where you take turns. So I think we\\'ve got that one down :) So much of this stuff just seems like common sense but I maybe it\\'s because I went to school for education. Hawk\\'s eyes are getting better every day. He really looks at people now. Still does not do a steady track of us or objects but we he will find things if you move them. And it seems like he only \"\"sun downs\"\" now when he\\'s working really hard at something or is sleepy. Today he went the chiropractor but otherwise just had a chill day at home. I fed him a about 3 tbls of cereal/pears/formula mixture by mouth when I got home. We played for about a minute and as soon as I handed him to our friend Laura Beth he was fast asleep. So I got to cook supper while she held him. John even helped me! I love to cook so that was fun even though I was so tired from my first full day of teaching. I made PF Chang\\'s mongolian beef. It was my third time making it and not my best but it can\\'t be perfect every time right? Today was hard for me emotionally. I can\\'t help but look at all the children at school and wonder what Hawk will or will not be able to do. Where will he fit in? What teacher will he need? Will he ever have a girlfriend? Will he feed himself at lunch? Will people treat him right when I\\'m not watching? I know this is a downward spiral and I try not to go there but just being honest it crops up in my mind as I walk the halls in those in-between moments. I figure every parent of a special needs child has these thoughts. Heck probably every parent has similar thoughts! We all just want the very best in life for our babies. As I type these very private thoughts some times it hits me like just now that many people are reading this. Believe it or not I\\'m a very private person. I\\'m horrible at meeting new people. John is the social one! I guess I can just type all of this on facebook because it feels private while it\\'s being typed from my couch at 11:30pm. It\\'s really a good way to get it all out. And I\\'m so grateful to my two sweet friends that started this page so early on in this journey and to all of you for listening and supporting us. Anyway back on topic...That brings us to tomorrow. Hawk has his helmet fitting appointment at 11am and feeding/OT at 1:30pm. I\\'m going to be sad to have to cover up that beautiful blond hair for 23 hours a day! But it will be worth it to help his head shape. I hate to miss appointments and therapies but Gramma and Dad will be there so it\\'s not like I worry. I just wish I was there too. When you send up your prayers for Hawk please say one for John as well. He is still battling really bad kidney stones. He is literally passing about 5 a week not exaggerating! He went for a CT scan today to see if his kidneys are damaged and to get a better idea of what\\'s going on. We know they are oxalate stones and diet and medicines have not helped yet. Not sure why we\\'ve seen this huge increase lately but it just won\\'t let up. If you have had kidney stones then you know how painful and exhausting they are to deal with. Thank you for your prayers for my men :)LoveKatie+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Hawk Harrison 55 months ago Share 11 So I\\'m up this morning trying to design a t-shirt for \"\"ª#\"\"ŽDoItForHawk\"\"¬ and I was thinking should I put the # in front or not? So I though well I will google DoItForHawk and see what comes up. It brings up the FB site the gofundme site the fundrazr site and twitter as the first few. I don\\'t have a twitter account so I never really thought about anything being on there but apparently it will let you look on even if you don\\'t have log in. There were quite a few tweets and most of them were from the first few days that Hawk was sick. It hit me like a ton of bricks. First off how amazing the support has been for us and second the reality that Hawk could have very easily not made it though those first few days. He was so sick and we found out much later that as the helicopter landed at Egleston the word around the PICU is that a baby was coming that was not going to live. I remember praying to God that if He was going to take Hawk to do it right then begging Him not to drag it out to then just let us down. So now I cling to Phillipians 1:6 being confident of this that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. As the days went on and Hawk made it though the first big procedure where they busted up the clot in his brain I remember John and I standing of his bed and laying hands on our 3 week old and proclaiming over and over again \"\"my baby will live and he will grow and he will thrive!\"\" John and I had a rule that every time either one of us stood up for anything we had to pray over Hawk. I had no idea then that Hawk was \"\"not supposed to make it\"\". I just knew that God had kept him around past the first night so there must be hope. Thoughts of these terrible days are both terrifying (that we could be back there again) and hopeful (because they give perspective on today\\'s issues). The picture below reminds me just how far we have come. We did not post pictures early on or allow very many people to see Hawk it was just to bad. But now we can look at these images of a reminder of the miracle we have seen. Please continue to pray for progress for Hawk on all levels and specifically now for his feeding issues. Thank you so so much!Katie+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Hawk Harrison 56 months ago Share 11 Oh it\\'s good to be home! I missed my sweet boy so much but we had a great time. Supper at Two Urban Licks was really good. I would recommend it for a cool date night we will be going back I hope. Last night after supper Pablo took us up to the roof of the W Downtown Atlanta. The view was breathtaking and the fact that we were on top of a building with no fence around it (because it\\'s the heli pad) was terrifying. I promise I woke up this morning with my knees still weak. One of the best parts of the trip was getting to sleep without thinking about if Hawk might throw up or did he kick the cover off and is to cold or did I remember to fill up and plug in the food back and who is going to get up and give the first medicines and so on... I\\'m sure you get the picture. Don\\'t get me wrong I love being a mommy but everyone needs a thoughtless night sleep every once in a while. I\\'m guessing every mom has their own set of things they think about as the lie down at night. AND we got to sleep late! If you know me you know I would sleep till noon every day if someone would let me so this was a great treat. BEST NEWS of the whole two days... Hawk did not throw up!!! Yay for prayers! I really know that you all are warriors for sweet Hawk and I will never be able to thank you enough. When we got home Daddy took Hawk for a walk in his new hiking baby back pack. John put it on the front of himself though since he was alone so he could see Hawk the whole time and help him keep his head up. Then John fed Hawk a whole ice cube (warmed up) of sweet potatoes. I\\'m getting so nervous about going back to work on Monday so I\\'m trying to get John to do all the stuff I usually do and I know it\\'s driving him crazy because I want him to do it just the way I always do. Again I\\'m sure this is a normal mommy kind of thing? Then we watched the Big Brother from Wednesday night but not the one from tonight yet so don\\'t spoil it for me if you are a fan of BB :) I\\'m so excited to spend all day with my little man tomorrow. I hope he\\'s having another talking day I sure do love that little voice of his. I will have to savor every moment of the next few days because pre-planning starts Monday. Gotta get that art room ready for 650+ elementary school kiddos! + Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Hawk Harrison 56 months ago Share 11 Just to answer a few questions...-Hawk is our only child we went through 5 years of infertility treatments to get him. 3 rounds of IUI miscarriage and 2 rounds of IVF. We plan on adopting other children in the future hopefully soon. So if you see other children with him they are all just friends. We are blessed to also have 2 wonderful God-children. -I had a healthy pregnancy normal c-section delivery at 41 weeks. Hawk was healthy until 3 weeks old when he had the brain hemorrhage. We have no family history of any of the problems he has.-He is currently 8 1/2 months old 21lbs 7oz 28 1/2 in long and has gray eyes-His official diagnosis is Intracranial hemorrhage Deep Vein thrombosis Epileptic (even though they do not believe he has a seizure disorder) obstructive hydrocephalus developmental delays feeding problem cortical vision impairment and possible clotting disorder(though not discovered). -He is on Nexium for acid reflux Neurontin for nerve pain Phenobarbital and Keppra for seizure control and Lovenox injections for clotting control. -All the blood from the initial hemorrhage has resorbed. -His shunt is controlling the drainage of his CSF his verticals are smaller and his brain is more relaxed filled in and has folds. This is improvement seen from a CT scan in May and another in July. -His blood clots in his arms are gone and the DVTs in his legs and abdomen are better. He has flow in all of them and you can see that his body is also using his surface veins to re-route some of the blood because these veins are so much darker than they should be. I will try to remember to post a picture of them. -He has not had a seizure in months the last one I can really remember was in February. -He goes to physical occupational speech vision and play therapies for his developmental delays. We work with him at home every day and the pool helps too! He still does not have full head control trunk control cannot sit or stand unassisted cannot crawl or scoot only makes about 5 \"\"word\"\"\\x9d sounds a day is starting to smile some. His hypotonic muscle development (weak muscles) make it hard to do things. He has some tone in the mornings but it\\'s getting better. Some clonis in his ankles and wrists. He has full range of motion and we stretch him daily to maintain this. -He has an ng feeding tube as his primary source of nutrition. He can eat baby food but does not like to because of his strong oral aversion due to brain injury and multiple surgeries. He failed his swallow study for liquids so we are working on that. He will not suck a bottle when he is awake but will in his sleep. We hope that he will overcome his feeding issues quickly enough to not need a G tube. -He has had 6 brain surgeries. EVD placement to drain blood 1st shunt 1st shunt revision 2nd shunt revision shunt removal and EVD placement because of infection and final shunt placement. These are the only surgeries he has had. -Hawk can see we are just not sure what or how much. His optic nerve is normal. His vision problems are due to the brain damage. -The doctors believe that Hawk\\'s bleed came from a clot that backed up a vessel in his brain and caused it to burst. He has since clotted off a PIC line in his leg causing the DVTs to form a PIC line in his arm causing a small sub-clavian clot in the right arm his blood pressure cuff that was left on in the PICU caused a small clot in his left arm. He has also clotted off IVs ART lines and his urinary catheter. He has been tested for every clotting disorder that has been discovered and all results come back normal. He will be tested for new things as they come out but until then blood thinners are the treatment. -Hawk lives with his Mommy (Katie) Daddy (John) and Gramma (Fran) 2 boxers (Rowdy and Sneaky Pie) and 2 cats (Bob and Target) in northeast Georgia. -Hawk seems to like big stretches in the morning his hands the sound of his kitties the feel of his doggies the color blue things that make noise when he plays with them swimming standing up other children Mommy\\'s voice Gramma\\'s lap Daddy\\'s kisses sweet potatoes and Krispy Kream glaze!-We attend 12 Stone Church Flowery Branch campus-We believe that God has a calling for Hawk\\'s life and we pray for His perfect will complete healing and blessings for you all. We praise God for Hawk and the many blessings He has already given us.Hope this is clear and gives you specifics to pray for and let me know if you have any other questions.

       " 'Update 1 Posted by Jake VanVeen 7 months ago Share Thank you to everyone who has been so supportive through this process. The overwhelming love that you have shown Jake and his family has made all the difference during this difficult time. We wanted to take a minute to make sure you all are up to date on his progress! Jake had surgery on July 6th to remove the tumor from his femur and replace the lower half of his bone with a prosthesis. The surgery was successful and he is now undergoing intense physical therapy to regain full mobility in his leg. Pathology results revealed that the whole tumor was indeed extracted and was 95% necrotic upon removal. This means that the chemo is doing its job in effectively killing the cancer cells which is very encouraging as Jake enters the second half of his treatments. If all goes according to plan he should complete chemotherapy by the end of the year. Jake has come a long way but his battle is not over yet.

Please continue to keep Lucy baby Watson and Jeremy in your prayers. \"\" Just one year ago Jeremy and I took our vows to love each other and stick together through sickness and in health. We had no idea this vow would put us to the test so soon with such a painful and scary doctor\\'s diagnosis. Despite the physical pain and emotional struggles over the past few weeks I have never felt so fortunate and loved by so many people. My heart is bursting with gratitude and emotion to see the most genuine love and encouragement from friends family new neighbors the entire skating community new students and old students and even support from kindhearted people who we have never met. Today on our wedding anniversary I am experiencing a love that goes so much deeper than the happy hugs and kisses in times of smooth sailing. Jeremy spends every night sleeping crunched up in a chair by my side he carries me through when I crack and I love him so much. Our families have shown their deepest love for us they\\'ve put their lives on hold to help get us through this with as many smiles as possible and of course Baby Barrett is keeping us all strong he\\'s hanging in there like a champ happy as a clam in the womb. Thank you so much everyone for showing me that love truly does outweigh all.

It truly does mean the world to us. Second we're asking for more prayers as Jackie is having gallbladder surgery tomorrow. Crossing our fingers for laparoscopic and not open surgery so her hospital stay and recovery time will be shorter. Since she's been dealing with this medical issue and everything with Adam she hasn't even been able to deal with the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension which she will possibly need another surgery for! Third Adam's latest PET scan showed that the spots that lit up on his lungs were most likely just an infection (thank God!) and he'll be starting the first of 17 radiation treatments next Monday. Hopefully they will conquer these battles life has thrown at them and things will start brightening up for them ASAP! Lastly our cousin Katie is running in the Martha's Vineyard Marathon to help spread awareness for Hodgkin's Lymphoma and in support of Adam. 26.2 miles! You go Katie! We can't thank you for enough for doing this for #TeamAdam! You are amazing!

This will tell me if there is still lymph nodes on my lungs that are lighting up if so I will need to get a biopsy to determine exactly what they are. So please keep your fingers crossed with me. The 21st is also the day I start radiation treatments in my neck where the lymphoma was. I will be receiving 17 radiation treatments Monday thru Friday for 3 1/2 weeks. After that another scan will follow to determine that all the scar tissue in the lymph nodes is gone. As for an update on how things are going with Jackie she has gone through many tests and her doctors are trying various medications to try to get her symptoms managed for now. She is waiting on a specialist for her intracranial hypertension where they will decide whether or not to precede with surgery.

       " '\"Update 19 Posted by Krysta Metcalf 11 months ago Share Hello everyone - It\\'s been a long while since I did an update on Miss Reanna so I thought I would fill you all in. Reanna has been on her third trial for around five months. Her new treatment is a targeted chemo to her liver in hopes to kill cancerous cells and keep her tumors from growing. While she has had slight growth in her tumors her doctor is still labeling her current state as stable disease which is where she wants and needs to be! Reanna is still flying to Houston TX every three weeks for her treatment. My brother typically goes with her for her longer stays but her mother and a few friends accompany her on the shorter visits which is a nice mix up for her. Her friend Jen calls it \"\"Cancer Camp\"\" and I\\'m pretty sure those two cause their fair share of trouble when they\\'re there together! :)Although the treatments themselves have been somewhat easier on her she was on other medications that weren\\'t so kind to her. She was having a lot of neuropathic pain in her hands and feet as well as a lot of join pain. There was a bout of three weeks where she was unable to get out of bed. Her doctor has since switched her medications and her new prescriptions seem to be working much better for her.We are extremely grateful that Reanna\\'s cancer is stable and she is able to stay on this trial. Right now this trial is where they need her to stay. She has had slight growth in her tumors and they need her to stay under a certain growth marker in order to stay on the trial. Please pray that she stays under this growth marker as after this trial there are no more trials she can currently begin. She will be put on a standard care course.Nathan and Reanna have had SO many people help them on this journey. We have had so many people donate anonymously and we cannot express our gratitude for everything everyone has done to get them to this point. Her treatment is expensive in and of itself but adding travel and hotel on top of it along with their normal day to day expenses is quite hard. Because we are at the beginning of a new year they now have new deductibles to meet which means a lot of money out of their own pockets. Reanna\\'s scan and blood work are also not covered on this trial and the bills are once again adding up!I know there are so many people fighting this disease and so many people needing help. If you would like to donate to Reanna\\'s fund you can do so at the link below. Please also consider becoming a blood donor for so many people out there need blood on a daily basis. I also urge all of you to pay it forward and continue to do something kind for your friends family and total strangers in your lives!Thank you for takaing time to read Reanna\\'s updates. We continue to pray for all of those we know that are in the midst of their own battles. We also continue to THANK each and every one of you for all of your support on this journey! Nathan and Reanna are so GRATEFUL!!!!!Be well Krysta xx + Read MoreUpdate 18 Posted by Krysta Metcalf 16 months ago Share Hello all -It\\'s been a little while since I\\'ve posted so wanted to give everyone a quick update. Reanna is in the midst of her third trial. She has treatment every three weeks in Houston TX. Nathan and Reanna are hopeful that this trial will work to keep her cancer stable. She will fly to Houston next week to have a scan that shows how well the treatment is working. Her last blood work results were good so they were happy with that and hope it\\'s a sign of a great upcoming scan outcome.The main thing about this trial is that if it is working and continues to work Reanna will need to travel to Houston every three weeks indefinitely. There is no cure for her cancer so that means she will be in treatment until a cure is found. This unfortunately is a great financial strain on their entire family. The medical bills from her treatments have piled up the organization that was helping with flights to Texas cut their funding leaving them to pay for flights out of pocket once again along with hotel stays and rental cars - all of this on top of their normal day to day bills. It has been a struggle this year to keep up with it all. We have had amazing friends and family step in to help when they can and for that we cannot say thank you enough. If you have anything to give to this family even the smallest something it would mean the world. The holidays are coming up and their funds are already beyond limited the way it is. I would love to see them be able to get through the holidays and start 2017 with less financial stress.Also if any of you have any information regarding programs or organizations that help families fighting cancer pay for bills flights hotels etc would you kindly send the information my way at krysta@krystametcalf.com. I would greatly appreciate it.Please continue to pray for this family. They have been through more than anyone is aware of and every day is a struggle to get to the next. Any prayers well wishes healing juju good vibes - whatever you have - are most welcome!...and as always to everyone out there fighting the fight every day we are praying for you too!Be wellKrysta xx+ Read MoreUpdate 17 Posted by Krysta Metcalf 18 months ago ShareHello everyone -A lot has changed over the past few weeks so I thought I would bring everyone up to speed! As I mentioned in my last post Reanna\\'s first and second trial weren\\'t a good fit for her. Her body wasn\\'t responding the way her doctors and hoped it would. While her tumors were not growing in size they were becoming more active which is a sign the treatment isn\\'t working. Nathan and Reanna took a few weeks to regroup and come up with a new game plan for her treatment going forward. Reanna will begin her third trial a new treatment which involves targeted chemotherapy that attacks a certain protein which is found in 86% of the uveal melanoma tumors she has in her liver. This is a phase 2 trial with her original doctor Dr. Patel. There has been success with this treatment in previous patients and we\\'re confident that this treatment is going to be successful for Reanna as well! Reanna will continue her travels to Houston as her trial is still done at MD Anderson one of the leading cancer clinics in the US. The reason Nathan and Reanna chose to continue treatment at MD Anderson and chose this trial specifically is because Ocular Melanoma is a tricky cancer. It is a rare aggressive cancer that is biologically distinct from skin melanoma. It often spreads to the liver but cannot be treated like liver cancer. There is currently no cure for ocular melanoma but they are making strides every day in finding a treatment that will CURE this cancer. Every decision regarding treatment is a trial and error as every patient responds differently. Again we are hopeful this is the treatment that will finally put Reanna\\'s cancer in remission until they do find a CURE!!We would also like to give a HUGE THANK YOU to the Drake/Stover families (April Stover is a long time friend of Reanna) for helping fund Nathan and Reanna\\'s trip with the kids to California. Because of their generosity in gas lodging and a few fun adventures for the kids Reanna was able to receive holistic treatment in California to get her body in line before she begins her targeted chemotherapy. It was such a blessing that she was able to receive this treatment and we cannot express our gratitude for their generosity!!I continue to have people ask what they can do to help the Manthe family. There are a couple of things that would help them greatly. The medical bills are mounting from all of Reanna\\'s treatment. Funds from various programs designed to help cancer patients have been cut short this year leaving Nathan and Reanna to pay for all travel expenses out of pocket. Any donation would help them get caught up on travel expenses medical bills and day to day bills. Gas cards and grocery gift cards are always welcome as well and go a long way in helping them week to week. If you have any airline miles you\\'d like to donate that would be wonderful too. Reanna\\'s travels to Houston are frequent and require someone to fly with her so airline miles are always a big help as well.I say it every time but it is so important that all of you know how much our entire family appreciates the donations gift cards help with the kids etc. This is a tough journey and anyone who has walked this journey before knows the stress it causes. However we all remain positive and keep putting out the good vibes because there is only one outcome that is acceptable and that\\'s Reanna kicking cancer\\'s ass. That\\'s the end goal and that\\'s what keeps them going!!Prayers and love and healing light and good juju to everyone out there fighting their own battles!If you\\'d like to make a donation please click on the link to do so! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!!Be wellKrysta xx + Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Krysta Metcalf 20 months ago Share Hello all -It\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve written an update so I thought I would bring everyone up to speed. For those of you following along on Reanna\\'s journey you know it has been quite the ride from the very beginning. Reanna\\'s cancer is very rare and because of this her treatment needed to be at M.D. Anderson in Houston TX. It is one of the leading cancer institutes in the US with great success rates. Her team of doctors gave her information for trials that she could go into for treatment. After almost six month of travel back and forth to Houston we found out that her first trial wasn\\'t working. Her liver tumors weren\\'t getting bigger but they were more active. Because of this her doctor felt it was necessary to take her off of this trial and place her on a different trial. Reanna\\'s second trial in terms of treatment was a bit easier. She had to take a pill the size of baby aspirin three times a week. However the pill came with a pretty crazy side effect. It made everything she ate taste like a mixture of bitter dark chocolate and dirt - times TEN! She was having a hard time finding things to eat that didn\\'t make her feel ill and this resulted in a bit of weight loss. Her doctor wanted to make sure her weight stayed in a normal range so it has been a balancing act of finding things that taste okay and still provide nutrition.This past week Nathan and Reanna went back down to Houston to have scans done to see how her body was responding to the second trial. Unfortunately her scans produced the same outcome as her first trial - the tumors are not getting bigger but the liver is more active. This basically shows that the trial is not working.Nathan and Reanna took the news as well as can be expected but it is a bit deflating. So much time energy travel and money is put into her treatment. It requires a traveling companion hotel stay rental cars time away from her children stress on her body and is emotionally exhausting. Fighting cancer is a hard enough battle on it\\'s own and then there are so many added stressors on top of it all.We do not know the next steps for Reanna. No further treatment plan has been discussed at this time. Her doctor at M.D. Anderson will take her case back to the committee to see what treatment suggestions they can offer. Meanwhile Nathan and Reanna have been doing research on their own for other possible options. The tricky part about her cancer is that it\\'s not liver cancer. It\\'s Ocular Melanoma that has settled in her liver. It travels by bloodstream so you can treat the liver but it still remains in her body.I would kindly ask all of you to say some extra prayers put out all the good juju you have and send some healing light to Reanna. Nathan and Reanna want to find a treatment plan as soon as possible so that she can start to heal from all of this and resume a normal life.I am also kindly asking that if you have anything to donate please consider doing so. So many of you have been so gracious and we cannot thank you enough. The thing about cancer is that the bills never stop coming. Just because these trials haven\\'t worked doesn\\'t mean the bills stop. They now have to continue to pay for her first two treatment plans on top of paying for a new treatment when they figure out what that treatment will be. Even if you forego your daily coffee drink and donate $5 it all adds up and helps this amazing family that is going through so much!We know of so many others who are battling cancer. It\\'s not fair and it\\'s not right and it\\'s heartbreaking to hear of all of these stories. Please continue to pray for everyone fighting this battle and for everyone fighting please keep those boxing gloves on!Be well and fight on!Krysta xx + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 38 Posted by Bill Anderson 4 days ago Share After what seems like the longest start to the year I am happy to say that Kolton is home. He slept in his own bed and had Chase right next to him for most of the night. While I did wake up a few times throughout the night it was probably the best night of sleep I have had in months. Knowing the whole family was together under the same roof just seems to have a comforting feeling. Kolton is still very weak and will need to go to rehab to build up his strength but his mental health has already been given a massive boost. Just getting out of the hospital and riding in the truck put a huge smile on his face. He watched his new iPad most of the way home but just looked out the window to take in all of the scenery for some of the trip. Once he was home we saw glimpses of the old Kolton. He was singing along with his movies and already telling us about the ideas he has. We have waited a long time to have these moments back and we could not be happier.+ Read MoreUpdate 37 Posted by Bill Anderson 7 days ago Share Today marks 9 full weeks in the hospital for Kolton. He has made huge strides in getting better over the last week. Kolton is now walking while just holding our hand for support and continues to build up more strength every day. The good news that we have is Kolton is finally medically cleared to leave the hospital. We just need to wait until everything is setup and ready for him to go back to Spokane and start rehab. The rehab will just help Kolton continue to regain his strength to where it was before the transplant. Hopefully by this weekend Kolton will be sitting in the truck with me heading back to Spokane. He is very excited to get home and spend time with his puppy. It will be nice to have Kolton sleep in his own bed and under the same roof. Yesterday Kolton received a visit from The Little Wish foundation. They brought him a new iPad for his very own. Complete with a cool case to protect it. That was a great present he was able to open up. Now he has something new to play with at all of his appointments when he’s waiting. Thank you again to everyone for your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.+ Read MoreUpdate 36 Posted by Bill Anderson 24 days ago Share After spending 21 days in the ICU Kolton has been moved back into a standard oncology room. He still has the drain tube in his abdomen but is completely off of the CRRT machine. Hopefully this means that Kolton's kidneys are back to functioning normally and will continue to get better.He is starting to eat and drink more each and everyday. The main problem is his days and nights are a little mixed up and he wakes up every morning at 2 am not able to go back to sleep.The last 3 weeks have been some of the hardest times that Kristine and I have ever dealt with. It sucks seeing your child in so much pain and discomfort without being able to do anything to help except for be there. Kolton kept fighting but it felt like every step forward was followed by two steps back. I just had to keep thinking that in this battle Kolton would never give up. He will continue to fight and Kristine and I will be right by his side through everything.+ Read MoreUpdate 35 Posted by Bill Anderson 28 days ago Share Day 16 and I am happy to report that Kolton is doing better. They decided to put a tube into his abdomen to let the fluid drain that was building up in there. So far over 2.5 liters have been drained from his belly.As a result Kolton has been more active and talkative. He has even started to eat a little bit of food and drink juice and water. Along with drinking more fluids by mouth his kidneys are starting to produce more urine which is a great sign that things are starting to go back to normal.Over the next few day they are going to minimize his fluid intake through IV and see how his body responds to going off of the CRRT machine. This will be a big step as he will be moved out of the ICU if he continues on this path.It has been nice having a little more of the normal Kolton back these last few days. Hopefully he will start telling his stories soon. That's when we know he's feeling better.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

We have a long way to our goal $20000 and while I know this seems like a lot of money it is merely 5 months of life bills in their household with all that they are undertaking. Please keep up the good work and share this post with as many people as you can.Thank you!!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Jessie Huntoon 55 months ago Share As many of you know a close friend of ours Jessie Huntoon was recently diagnosed with Hodgkin\\'s Disease a form of cancer in the lymph nodes. Some of you may also remember that just a few years back in 2009 they lost everything in a home fire. Shortly after the fire they married anyway and started their life. In this short time they have begun to build again found long term housing and Jessie began working for Upper Valley Services and Rodney continued working for the Town of Moretown.Most of us know Jessie and Rodney as outgoing fun loving willing to help out always go the extra mile and have always given a lot of themselves to help others. What many of you do not know is that this recent blow with cancer has been far more damaging than they let on. In my talks with Jessie she has described to me how cancer has really affected her- sure they have health insurance sure they have each other and a home. But what they have lost has caused more trouble than anything and the fight with cancer on its own is not easy. I want Jessie to focus on fighting and beating cancer. I think all of us want her to focus on that and we need`This is how it was for them\"\"¦As Spring was turning its last corner into summer Jessie and her family were battling the unknown. In one instant all of their summer plans had been changed and new ones were being made. Jessie traded her busy schedule of working with the people she loves and feeling the rush of summer run through her veins for weekly appointments at Fletcher Allen and ultimately bi-weekly chemotherapy treatments. Along with the new diagnosis of Hodgkin\\'s Lymphoma also came the huge financial blow that cancer packs when it comes. Thankfully Jessie has insurance that covers most of her medical needs however along with losing one income new bills have emerged; there are now increased trips to Fletcher Allen the large deductible and other co-pays for her healthcare specialized foods for Jessie\\'s new diet and a mounting pile of bills that just cannot be covered by Rodney\\'s income alone. Turning to others for support has never been something that Jessie is comfortable doing as she is aware that so many are going through financial hardships but being faced with disconnection notices negative checking account balances and late rent statements she realizes she needs her peers as much as they all need her.What we need to do is do our best to help out friends through this difficult time. We may not have a lot but a little bit can mean the difference in having electricity and food and not having them. I created this page with their blessing to help do what we can to give back to these individuals that have always been there for us have helped us through our hard times and simply because they are our people- and frankly they need us.What this money will go to is bills transportation fees providing a clean and safe environment for Jessie while she is going through Chemo. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

In so many ways she\\'s an inspiration.Again I can\\'t thank you enough for your prayers. Sometimes this 8 year battle seams too much to bear but God ALWAYS uses you our friends family and supportive community to help us get through both financially emotionally and physically.

That means I get to go with her on the Cancer Treatment Center\\'s dime. The oncologist has ordered biopsies and because of the difficulty in reaching the tumors they put her under with anesthesia. She is required to have a caregiver because of that and that\\'s where I come in. I\\'m the caregiver!!! It\\'s awesome that I\\'ll be able to be with her when we find out the latest reports on the behavior of the tumors. We\\'re hopeful for favorable reports this time....

As many of you know 3 weeks ago we were at the Cancer Treatment Center and received news that 2 of Anni\\'s 3 tumors had grown in size. This was a hard blow to take but God has already used it for His glory in that it made me stronger. It was a rough few weeks but tears are again being controlled. Anni has blown me away at her strength and attitude and I\\'ve learned much from it.She is at the Cancer Treatment Center again as I\\'m typing this update. She has to be there alone this time because the Center wouldn\\'t pay my way. However when she goes back in 3 weeks on Feb 19 they WILL pay for me to go because she has multiple scans and another biopsy. The biopsy requires her to be put under anesthesia and that\\'s why they\\'ll pay my way. I get to be her baby sitter \\'er I mean Caregiver. We once again thank you for your prayers and encouragement. God is working.... I just can\\'t understand it yet...Our prayer requests are:1. that the tumors have stopped growing;2. Anni\\'s heart and liver can withstand the chemo they have her on;3. The biopsy in 3 weeks will give a conclusive result for a successful plan of action.4.

His symptoms of chest pains and breathing problems significantly subsided after the first cycle. This is seen as a good sign (hopefully) indicating the tumor\\'s sensitivity to chemo.Unfortunately UPMC put his treatment on hold after the first cycle of chemo while we worked through financing. Transplants (of any kind) are legally termed \\'elective\\' for treatment and therefore require a full deposit of amount prior to the treatment. After some negotiations UPMC has now agreed to take him in on the deposit of the raised amount and given us the flexibility of raising the remaining amount by November 2014.In order to help further with finances UPMC has opened a 501c3 applicable account for Taqi which offers tax rebate to donors. If you\\'re interested in donating to the UPMC account for tax rebate following is the information:Bank of New York Mellon500 Ross StreetPittsburgh PA 15262Routing Number: ABA 0430-00261Account Number: 118-5027IMPORTANT*Please note that the deposit must indicate that the donated amount is dedicated for \"\"Taqi Rizvi\\'s treatment\"\" to ensure the appropriate allocation of funds.*In order to receive a letter confirming you tax deductible donation once the amount is deposited please email Alec Kiderman at <kidermanaa@upmc.edu>.

This gives us time to raise the remaining amount without delaying treatment any further.His initial consultation is scheduled for July 9th. He has received his visa and travel arrangements have been made so that he is in Pittsburgh in time for his consultation.Taqi is stable health wise for travel.I also want to thank everyone who has constantly followed up and checked in with me.

We found that GoFundMe was the best way we could provide them with what they need right now. We didn't know what kind of support we could or should expect so we decided on a modest goal of $10000. We knew that although this amount would be a small drop in the bucket for the resources The Koosmann Family are going to require something small is better than nothing at all.Over the last two days we were all blown away by how fast we reached this goal but soon realized this should be no surprise at all. After all we know Brad and Noelle intimately and we know the type of people they are the friendships they have developed the family they were raised in and the family they are raising. With this it should come as no surprise that the vast network of people who love them would be happy to do whatever they can to help them on this journey. Providing a small donation to their cause so they can have all the resources they need through this process is such a simple but powerful way to help.It is for this reason we have decided to increase the GoFundMe goal to $25000. It is time to acknowledge the huge network of friends and family that love and care for this wonderful family. It is time to provide The Koosmann Family a return for the graciousness they have shared with all of us. Thank you for for your wonderful support prayers and donations!

To tell you the truth I don't know if anyone really still looks at it but I digress...I am now bald. It happened the day after Thanksgiving and my husband shaved my head. The da after we went out and I danced with the hat you see on my head in the first pic. That was an experience. The second pic is my with my friend Tiffany. We both got new haircuts so I thought it fitting to take a picture. I am currently hooked up to a machine that is taking my stem cells and after that I'll go into the hospital for a month to get through this stem cell thing. To everyone who has supported me and donated I want to say thank you! I didn't know how truly gracious and good people were until this whole experience (I'm a pessimist).

It is time to reflect on life and what it means to each and every one of us. The ability to have a Christmas and be able to give that to our family children is such a precious gift. The being able to wake up and hug the ones we Love and let them know how much they mean to us each and every morning and night is something we should never take for granted. To see the smile on someone's face everyday is something not to take for granted. To take the time to understand what each and everyone of us has going on in our lives and slow down to smell flowers look up at the buildings look at the people walking around and just think and be grateful for what you have and appreciate them.Take the time now!!! We are waiting to talk with the Oncologist to see about Rajah's treatments and for how long she will need to take them. Please keep her in your prayers and thoughts going into this New Year and know that she is a strong tenacious fighter and will Never give in to this. May everyone's Holidays be safe and full of Love!!!! Thank you and God bless. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Dad is out of the hospital - PTL! He was able to go home over the weekend and is very glad to be out of the hospital again. The doc thinks that the infection on his arm is fairly normal for someone in his situation. While he has no immune system to fight back the infection continued to spread. They now have him on some pretty heavy meds to contain it as he begins to fight the infection himself. The prayer request continues to be against fevers and that he would be able to rest and fight this cancer. His blood platelets are doing really well as of yesterday. He was down to 7 last week and is up to 2000 this week. We are hoping that Dad will be well enough for us to celebrate Christmas together away from any hospitals :)We would also appreciate prayers for Mom as she is the front line lady and has been an AMAZING nurse to Dad.

However here is an update from my parents and their journey/dream of running an Inn/B&B. Peter and I will be running the Wilderness Inn in Woodstock NH for this December and January on the weekends and the Holiday week. We will be taking over for the owner's while they are away for those two months. We would love for you to come and experience our hospitality and this beautiful majestic area. We are minutes from Loon and Cannon Mtn. and close to other big mountains for those of you who love to ski. Or if you would rather snowshoe cross-country ski or do some snowmobiling they are all very accessible. The Inn is in the village of Woodstock with restaurants and shopping moments away. We are able to offer a 20% discount the first weekend of January. It is a great getaway after the busy Holiday. If you are interested check out the website www.thewildernessinn.com. You can make reservations now we will be answering the phone starting December 1st. We would love to see you!

       " \"Update 37 Posted by Julia Arbery 3 months ago Share Dearest Friends and Supporters This is Monica writing and I know it has been far too long. I am so sorry! But in this case no news is very good news! I thank you now more than ever for all of your monetary and spiritual support which has carried me through so much. It is truly unbelievable. Words fail me and they seem so incredibly insufficient but here is an update- written with deep and abiding joy love and gratitude. I love you all so much.This summer was a disjointed terrifying maddening nightmare. I returned from California in April and unfortunately I was worse off than I was before receiving treatment. My body I think was just so done fighting and was running out of resources- so it was screaming for life and attention by any means necessary. That’s when the 4 hour daily seizures started and paralyzing fear and agoraphobia. My personality completely changed and my body tingled constantly with anxiety and panic. When I say I went out of my mind- I really did. I had no idea who I was anymore and could not conceive of a future in which I was not bedridden and in every sort of pain. My mind no longer belonged to me. It was this foreign agent of war that constantly berated me with thoughts I do not wish to recall. But suicide seemed like the reasonable compassionate choice. Thoughts of how and when I would die completely consumed me. It was not that I had just lost hope for healing- it was much deeper than that much more sinister and something I’m not quite sure how to write about. But whatever hope is- I lost all of it.And that time is a hazy one- and it is hard to pinpoint any one thing that pulled me out of it. Honestly I don’t really remember and that may be a great mercy of God. I remember my brother flying out to be with me and we watched so many movies. We both cried at the closing dream in Raising Arizona. I had friends who would not leave me-- and who understood with great grace when I needed a long time of solitude to remember who I am and who God is. I went to a homeopathic practitioner whose whole family had had Lyme disease and were all healed- and she was so unfazed by my wildly depressed mind because she had been there before and knew that it gets better. It gets better. An unlikely friend held my hand and read my favorite poem to me and I knew something had been returned to me- some mysterious and very real gift of life. I sat outside and read Faulkner. I ate my favorite cheeseburger. I saw the total eclipse of the sun with my Dad and we both cried. I felt small and big and loved.Then in August a family friend came to visit and encouraged me to work with another family friend who had healed her years before. I have no idea what made me say yes but I did. And then everything changed very quickly and very deeply. With the guidance and support of this dear beautiful health coach and healer I started very gentle treatments in light therapy and Nes Health. You can read more about both here:https://www.neshealth.com/https://inlightmedical.com/light-therapy/I never ever ever ever ever ever thought I would get better. But as soon as I put the lights on my body in August I felt a shift. My brain fog started clearing my memory got so much better my anxiety and depression ceased- and I am in absolutely no pain. No pain! And I just returned from a trip from Texas and Washington- visiting friends and my beloved and our families and furthering this wonderful treatment. It was a trip of such celebration and love. The change has been so dramatic and drastic that I really am at a loss for words. You would never know that I had been so sick. I cannot believe my good fortune that when I had really given up the perfect people and the perfect treatment came to me and saved my life. It is an immeasurable blessing the biggest blessing- and I hope hope hope that this reaches someone who may be sick with Lyme or some other chronic illness and that this helps you. I KNEW I would either die or be stuck in bed for the rest of my life and I was so wrong. And that is the best: to think that pain is final and has the last word and then to be surprised and struck down by healing and elation.I am healing so well and my body is so strong that I am looking to start work again soon- I cannot believe it!!!! It is such a gift to think about what I would like to do again and I ask for your continued prayers as I make this transition back into the world. I have a little surgery later this month to get my port removed (!) and then I expect some new and exciting changes in the new year.I remember a pregnant resident at Heather’s House in Chicago saying “God lets you dig your own grave and then He takes one hand and pulls you out.” And I remember the words of Saint Teresa of Avila: “God had no hands on this earth but yours.” Thank you for being God’s hands even when you have not known it. You have made this a story of triumph. Pain is so real and it is so necessary- but we can often entomb ourselves in our pain and be terrified to come out. We cannot persevere in pain alone nor can we begin again alone and you all have shown me how deeply true that is. And I thank you for rejoicing with me now. Every tiny thing feels like such a victory because it is. Every tiny thing is charged with so much because I have gotten to this ordinary and gorgeous moment from the sacrifices and prayers and love of all of you. I pray that you know how very true that is. I love you and I thank God for you.“Wait for God cling to God and wait for him; at the end of it thy life shall blossom anew.” (Sirach 2)LoveMonica+ Read MoreUpdate 36 Posted by Julia Arbery 6 months ago Share 11 Friends It's been a while and we wanted to send along an update on Monica's progress. It has been a hard summer but the seizures have stopped. She's started a new homeopathic treatment that is expensive and difficult but which we believe is working slowly. She also may have to travel in the near future for treatment outside of Wyoming and Colorado. It's amazing that traveling is even on the table though there's still a long road to recovery ahead!Monica wanted to tell you that she's feeling so much love and gratitude. We ask for your prayers and if possible that you spread the word about this campaign. We anticipate a lot more costs in the year ahead. But we're feeling so much hope.+ Read MoreUpdate 35 Posted by Julia Arbery 10 months ago Share Friends asking for your continued prayers for Monica. Two nights ago she had a two hour long unconscious seizure last night and had to be taken again to the hospital by ambulance. With the neurological damage and more frequent convulsions happening please pray that she gets the medical help she needs in Wyoming. She is fighting confused and in pain but at peace with God's deeper and bigger plan in all of this. She's feeling hopeful but the prayers bring her much needed peace and she's especially worried about how this affecting her family. We're of course just worried about her unending pain. What a cycle of worry. We're just grateful that we have so many wonderful souls on her side as we continue to fight this thing. As always we'd be so grateful if you passed this campaign along to anyone who might be willing to help. Even though we've raised so much money it's amazing how quickly it evaporates as we battle this under-insured under-exposed illness. Hope you're having a wonderful Spring. Thank you so much. + Read MoreUpdate 34 Posted by Julia Arbery 10 months ago Share Dear Friends this is Monica. Firstly as always I want to thank you for your unfathomable generosity. I often wonder how we became so fortunate to receive such outpourings from friends and strangers- but even as I do not understand it- I just thank God and see the graces of love in all of you. Thank you.Now once again we ask for your prayers. I have been experiencing paralysis more than I ever have and last evening (Divine Mercy Sunday) it culminated in a very terrifying way as I had some sort of epileptic fit for several hours. I do not remember everything that happened but what began as being unable to move my body developed into intensely painful convulsions especially on my right side and I lost the ability to speak. Thankfully my dear friend was with me and I got to the hospital by ambulance. Much of it is a blur but I remember feeling very terrified and praying that I would be able to speak again and praying for peace for my family and friends. My parents’ flight landed from New York while I was in the ER and they came straight to the hospital. The ER doctor knows my parents (tiny town) and he was wonderful- and he said that these episodes of paralysis and this seizure could be the beginnings of epilepsy and that I need to work more with my neurologist to figure that out- but it is also unfortunately symptomatic of the most advanced stages of Lyme disease. And so we ask for your prayers. My treatment in California was so good but it is difficult for all of us that I am in one of the lowest valleys I have ever been in after having had intensive treatment for many months. But this reality gives us a drive to fight and to pursue other options and do the next right thing. I am so thankful for all of our dear friends who have suffered with Lyme as well who are leading us in what feels like a walk in the pitch dark. I love all of you and I am so very grateful for what you have done and all that you do. Please pray for the chronically ill. Please pray for those with this disease and join us in raising awareness for it. Please pray for the dying- especially those who do not have anyone to care for them. And please pray for the soul of Kelly Gaffney who died last week from cancer and whose funeral is today. Kelly suffered so beautifully and loved so well-- she is a bright bright light still and in her own incredible pain she was a selfless joy and force of goodness for me and so many others.God bless you all and I love you so much and I thank God everyday for you.“Eternal God in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion — inexhaustible look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will which is Love and Mercy itself. Jesus I trust in You.”All my loveMonica+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

As a family we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Words can't express how much it means. Please keep sharing our story and THANK YOU!! xxx+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Kalindi Monie 31 months ago Share 11 My older brother Toren was diagnosed with a brain tumour on the 11/6/14. He had the tumour removed on the 17/6/14 with biopsy taken for formal diagnosis. It was his 3rd wedding anniversary and his wife was 20 weeks pregnant with their first child. After an agonising 2 weeks waiting period for the biopsy results the day after they were told they were having a baby girl Toren was given the devastating news he has Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) stage 4 brain cancer. This is an incurable cancer which spreads rapidly.Toren and Adele met in 2008 while Adele visited Australia from Ireland. It was love at first sight and even with the obstacle of having to return to Ireland for 6 months we all knew that Adele would be a permanent fixture in our family. They were married in June 2011 and started trying for a baby. Over the coming 3 years my sister-in- law had 3 miscarriages and 2 ectopic pregnancies resulting in the loss of both of her fallopian tubes. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was the only option to start their family. They never gave up the dream of being parents no matter the obstacles and heartache along the way and thankfully it worked. However at 9 weeks into the pregnancy they were told that Adele was more than likely losing the baby. By some miracle our little Angel held on. Zoe is now 9 months old. Becoming a father is one of the best things that has ever happened to him and he is absolutely besotted by his little girl. Toren for the last year has been on Chemotherapy for 5 days every month and has remained positive that he would be the exception of this deadly disease. He would be the one that beat it. Toren is an inspiration to anyone. He has always worked hard to make his dreams come true.Last week Toren had a repeat MRI of his head and the results have come back with terrible news. He now has 2 new tumours growing and they are too deep to operate. The doctors have said that he can start taking medication intravenously in the hope of slowing the growth of the tumours but Medicare doesn’t cover it and the cost is $25000. He has never taken handouts and is too proud to even ask but with the doctors telling him he can no longer work or drive and they still have a mortgage to pay I’m praying that by setting up this page we can help them is some small way. We are starting this GoFundMe page in the hope of raising enough money for the medications and for Toren to enjoy the time he has left with his family without the added financial pressures. Any assistance however small would be greatly appreciated. Thanking you in advance + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Best news of all.... her cancer has dramatically shrunk. If you don\\'t believe in the power of prayer I hope Maddie\\'s story encourages you to. She was originally told she would under go another 6 rounds of chemo.. plus potentially radiation but it looks like her chemo treatment might be less now. What a blessing from above!! As I talked to her tonight for multiple hours her spirits seemed high and she is able to be a mother wife and a friend again. She is on her feet doing what she does best and that is being her fun positive self. I feel so blessed to know such an inspirational person. Please continue to pray for full recovery for Madison and please pray for her family as she still continues treatment and time away from them. If you feel called to donate please do so!

I just got back from a trip and I plan on getting back to logging on often starting Monday! Update on Madison-I couldn\\'t wait to get back from Florida to see Madison. I knew she had been struggling a lot this past week with her being extremely sick and also feeling very down. I had talked to her two days prior to coming back home on FaceTime. She kept trying to explain something about cups and totally forgetting mid conversation what she was saying. I could see the frustration in her eyes as she stumbled for words. Sweet Cole removed the phone from her and calmed us both down by telling us to call each other back later. I personally have never had to watch someone go through something like this nor have I ever had to feel the pain of not being able to help. I hate not being able to control a situation and this was one of them. I cried because I was worried I had lost my 4 hour conversations with my best friend. As I arrived to the hospital nervousness of seeing her set in. I was expecting to walk in and see a totally different person due to her being so sick. I really wanted to make Maddie felt better by the time I left so I opened up the door and walked in hugged her skinny little self pulled out the goodies I bought before heading there and began making conversations. She was just as vibrant as I remembered. Her laughing filled the room while I did her make up and I even messed up the fake eye lashes. Talk about a good laugh! :) She looked great! It was on to her nails. We sat doing her nails while she vented to me about how she wasn\\'t feeling confident about how she looked. By the end of that conversation her nails were done and she really did start becoming \"\"Madison\"\" again. I gave her a ring that I ordered with her husband and two kids birth stones in it so it was a constant reminder of what she had waiting for her at home. She was thrilled! After all was said and done I got her dressed in her new shirts and headbands I brought for her. She has two bags worth and many more coming.. including those really pretty head scarves she has been wanting! Yay! We took pictures of her so she could look and see what we all see! She got to see how gorgeous with or without hair she really was. The best part about her has always been her awesome personality! I encouraged her to be what attracted her husband and friends to her the most confident. By the end of being there I saw her confidence return and strength gleaming off of her!Madison is getting back on track to recovery and she said word for word \"\"I\\'m tired of saying I am going to kick cancer\\'s butt. I hate cancer and what it has done to me. I\\'m ready to kick cancer\\'s ass!\"\" She is in good spirits and is fighting to get her blood counts back on track so she can return home to her family and friends who can\\'t wait to squeeze her!

Right now she is experiencing a lot of nauseafatigue and hair loss. She did however get to see her sweet husband and two precious little boys.

Unfortunately she had to go back to surgery yesterday as her incision on the left side opened up. Her surgeon explained that it had to be repaired immediately since he had to create a flap with healthy tissue in order to close it back up. The left side is where she had the radiation so that tissue requires extra healing time. She was able to go home last evening and was pretty sore and tired. She is going to have to be extra careful in the weeks ahead in order for that tissue to heal properly. Please include Wendy in your prayers!+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Jami O\\'Brien 39 months ago Share Wendy update!!

I will post another update after the surgery to let everyone know how everything went and how Wendy\\'s feeling.+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Jami O\\'Brien 42 months ago Share Hello I wanted to give an update on Wendy- she was starting to feel better but is now diagnosed with lymphedema. This was somewhat to be expected since 16 lymph nodes were removed during the mastectomy. This means that lymph fluid can build up in the affected side of the body and cause swelling. So this means further treatment: 3 days per week of physical therapy and the wearing of a compression sleeve. Wendy will have to wear this sleeve forever as this condition will never go away but can be controlled with the sleeve and therapy. I think she needs a sleeve that looks like a tattoo sleeve- she can change it up! Her hair is starting to come in and even went to see her hairdresser yesterday to get it \"\"shaped\"\" a little. I think she is contemplating going wig-less. I would like to thank everyone for your continued prayers and support- it has meant a lot! + Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Jami O\\'Brien 43 months ago Share Last day of radiation today-YAY!

       " '\"Update 9 Posted by Michael Burke 7 months ago Share 77 Good afternoon. It has been some time since my last update and I wanted to let everyone following my story know the latest and greatest.First of all today is my 39th birthday and I thank god I am here to enjoy today with my family and friends! I also want to thank all of you because you all very much inspired me to fight this terrible cancer and make it to this point. Every day the sun is shining and I can take a deep breath of fresh air is a good day!!Before I continue I ask that you all say a prayer for the family of Chris Sabia. I met Chris early in my journey as he was diagnosed with lung cancer within a month of my diagnosis. We had the exact same mutation and were initially on the same medicines. We are also the exact same age and both never smoked. Chris is from Connecticut and has a beautiful wife and young son. Unfortunately Chris\\'s cancer took a turn for the worse and he just passed away Thursday night. I had just texted with him last week and he seemed hopeful his new treatment was going to work. It is a painful reminder of how fast this disease can take the most brave and wonderful people which Chris certainly was. You can probably find Chris\\'s story on google or Facebook but I will never forget him and will use him as additional motivation to find a way to beat this. Life sometimes isn\\'t fair and I wish his wife and son the very best as they try to get through this.My most recent scan wasn\\'t the best and I have been in some pain recently. It showed that my lung lymph nodes and hip were stable but I had progression with new nodules in the pleural space around my lung near some nerves. The tumors were fortunately too small to biopsy. This means the cancer is starting to become resistant to the Tagrisso I am taking. However rather than rushing into a new treatment I took a consult with specialists at Mass General in Boston last week. That visit went well and they mapped out all the directions my cancer could go and what the treatments would potentially be (clinical trials requiring frequent travel or chemo). They also said that because my cancer is progressing on the slower side let\\'s squeeze as much time as possible out of my current treatment before re-biopsying and switching treatments because usually you can\\'t go back. Cancer is a game of buying time so we are hoping to get a few more months before making a change. The doctors were also refreshingly in favor of me keeping my special diet supplements IV treatments etc. They were surprised that I was still working full time and coaching. \"\"If you are feeling good and the progression is slow why change anything?\"\" Unfortunately all these things coupled with medical bills are very expensive and we are spending more than I make but how do you choose what to pull out of my regimen?Therefore we are moving to phase two of my go fund me campaign. I extended my goal to help get us through this next stretch. If you all can help me spread the word and click SHARE for people who may have missed it the first time I would appreciate any and all help. I may have to start traveling more as well. We are looking into a consult at Sloan Kettering in New York in a couple weeks and don\\'t know if my next treatment will be here at Hopkins in Boston or New York. We are trying to make as many connections as possible and stay on top of the latest in cancer treatement developments. I also continue to see my integrative doctor who brings new ideas to the table monthly.I apologize for the long message but appreciate each and every one of you. The amount of love support and true caring that has been shown is difficult to put into words. I promise you all that I will never give up the fight and remain positive!!With peace and loveMike Burke+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Michael Burke 13 months ago Share I have been getting a lot of questions as to my status recently and I wanted to provide a quick update. I have been having some pain on the left (non-cancer) side of my chest over the past month. I remained active and tried not to think much of it but after a couple weeks of not getting better I started to worry. I had a CT blood work and saw my doctors last week and the good news is my cancer is completely stable! The slightly bad news is I actually have a fractured rib from playing basketball. Just need to rest and it should heal naturally. Other than that I feel great and continue to have a positive attitude. Thank you for everyone who has checked in on me and has been praying for us. I remain confident I can beat this!Mike (and Michele)+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Michael Burke 16 months ago Share 11 Hello everyoneFor those who have been asking Michael has been feeling really well. His next scan is scheduled in January.If you haven\\'t seen it yet the Ravens did a nice article on Michael and how he\\'s helping change the face of lung cancer.

We wish everyone a Happy Holiday season:)Michele+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Michael Burke 18 months ago Share 11 Good afternoonI wanted to post a quick update because a lot of things have changed since my last update. A couple weeks ago I started having a lot of pressure in my chest and was becoming a little short of breath. I ended up going to the ER to find out that my right lung was 50% filled with fluid (pleura effusion). I was in the hospital for three days and had a chest tube put in which drained over 3 liters of fluid. Thank goodness for my amazing wife Michele who was bringing me my organic food and kangen water to the hospital each day so I didn\\'t have to eat the hospital food!They tested the fluid to find out that my cancer had mutated to T790m and I had to switch treatments. I am now taking Tagrisso which is another targeted pill similar to Afatinib and if effective will control any spread of the cancer and hopefully fix the fluid building up in my lung. I had a pleurx catheter put in so I can now drain at home until I am healed. Our hope is that this medicine will work for a year (or more...fingers crossed) to buy me more time until the next best treatment option becomes available.I am happy to be home and back going to work. Thank you to all who continue to pray for me and my family and send nice messages. We appreciate all the love and support!Mike+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 11 Posted by Kelley Dougan 42 months ago Share Looks like we have raised $1240 so far friends thanks guys love kel+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Kelley Dougan 42 months ago Share Its 3 in the morning laying here in my hospital bed I started this message at 130 and my phone for some reason shut off I had already shut my phone off for bed but the words came. I can't possibly recreate heartfelt tears that went into my erased message but I can do my best to share with you the most important points These are deep waters I now wade. I have a whole community and family all around me supporting me and yet I still find myself in deep deep waters. My Heart is heavy now there are lots of tears. I'm so thankful for all of the prayers u have sent me and even though I could not personally respond to each of you I felt all of your hearts. As my nurses wheeled me to a special room where they punctured my spinal fluid to see if there were cancer cells in my brain one of the ladies told me her son Kelly read the Gaelic meaning for his name meant war I responded brave warrior. During the procedure I thought of my own name brave warrior of God fighting in the darkness. I I know that I am that warrior fighting with honor and for what I believe and warriors don't always win the battle but if I die I die knowing who I am mind you I'm not gone yet but things aren't looking so bright. To shine my light for a day or even A moment in this world has been a gift to me .If you saw me now you would not recognize me as the Kelly you know I am no longer building rock garden beds in my backyard painting walls or dancing with my kids. I can no longer dress myself or walk up or down my stairs I have a fractured femur as a result of the bone cancer that has spread from my sternum to my shoulders my ribs my spine  hips and produced multiple lesions in my liver. But I am still fighting still giving it everything I've got. Doctor say I could do hormone therapy for the bone cancer the problem is the lesions in the liver require more aggressive chemo that will make me lose my hair nauseous vomit among 50 pages worth of side effects that chemotherapy can create. Not an easy decision to make do I spend my 18 months in agony and pain in front of my family ? Do I take the risk of possibly being a 2% one of the few who survived beyond they're 18 month diagnosis or do I choose another way a more peaceful way a way of the earth? While here in the hospital I realized I am not afraid to die but I do have attachments first and foremost my children I'm attached to being an example for them and influence attached to helping them through their traumas bumps and bruises and eventually helping them with their babies just as my mom is doing for me. But I also know and find comfort and the fact that they will have love in their lives even when I am gone. It was an alternative treatment called to feathers I had just started brought me to the hospital I thought I was sick and vomiting and had no appetite because of the medication. Turns out it was the cancer leaching the calcium from my bones and delivering it to my blood I was at a-level 13.9 when I arrived on Saturday level 14 causes coma and eventually death. They have flushed my blood with ivs bringing me back to a stable blood calcium level but I will have to be on a drug every month that will stabilize and return the calcium to my bones. I started this fundraiser on my own because it is not easy for me to ask others for help but now I ask for help from my friends and their friends and their friends for my family. The month before I was diagnosed with breast cancer my husband inherited 60000 which I was determined to buy a house with and we did but it is a 777 square foot 2 bedroom and all my kids sleep in one room in bunk beds and a loft the plan was for my husband to add on to the House with our tax return he started this but the fundraiser was not enough for me to cover all the expenses related to my treatments and our next tax return went to cancer rather than the continuation of our add on so I ask not only for your donations so that my 62 year old declining husband can finish the project but also for any volunteer construction workers who can help can complete this project for my family. Tomorrow I go in for hip surgery and a blood transfusion to try to bring me more strength maybe it's good that I stayed up until 430 in the morning perhaps it is a good way to get through the operation I want to hurry up and post this posting before my phone dies again also want to thank you in advance Oh My Love in sincerity kel+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Kelley Dougan 46 months ago Share Hi there since I got home there has been much keeping me busy. I will head back to TJ to finish dental work in Aug. I have started a new on going alternative treatment with many success stories behind it I pray it works for me.I want to share how the last few weeks have been to keep it real with all of you. First I want to express my thanks for all ur blessings and ask u to keep my healing in ur prayers it aint over til its over... In TJ the DR. found a lump under my arm that has grown since my return. I was stressed to the max while I was there It didn't help that a friend who cured himself of lymphoma got on FB and said he knew someone who did everything I was doing and is now dead. I was just not strong enough at the time to be able to integrate that and stay positive and I went into a deep depression. His intentions I'm sure were good but timing was all wrong. When I got home my hubby was also stressed to the max from having to keep it all going without me for so long and we were at each others throats for a week. This furthered the strain. To cope with my fear and try to turn around my spirits I did the opposite of what I should have and ate and drank what ever I wanted. The lump grew as a result of it all. I felt the heat and sensation of the circulation being cut off. It was affecting me in ways I'm still processing. Everyday I can not help but consider what I could leave behind and how it will all get managed. My hubby is 62 years old and our youngest is 4. My 63 year old mom lives near by and helps with the kids. She is not the healthiest she follows in the footsteps of her father who died at 65. Luckily my grandma is 90 and living with her. My sister still lives in Maui after I begged her to come live with me when I still lived there she doesn't know my 2 littlest kids that well. The twins father hasn't associated with them since they were 4 almost 12 now.Every time I sit in fear I try to take a breath and remember all the amazing miracles my life has seen and rewrite this current story. Not to be in denial but to take responsibility for what I'm creating.I took Thursdays off to dedicate to my intentional healing. Already I have emotional transformation work of all sorts lined up... I had an amazing Tarot and astrology reading that helped change my perspectives and set the tone for internal work. One strong message I got is that I was set on this earth to heal myself; If others benefit in some way from my journey hooray but I release myself from some subconscious belief that their healing was in some way my obligation.

       " '\"Update 7 Posted by Jordan Scott 20 months ago Share Hello everyone as I\\'m sure all of you have been waiting for the next update and here it is! This has been one crazy time what feels like months has only been about 10 days. My mom\\'s surgery was one of the scariest times I\\'ve been though. I honestly think I could have found a needle in a hay stack quicker than those 10 hours of her surgery. Luckily everything has gone well. Today she went to her Medical Oncologist and we have fantastic news to report all the prayers and positives vibes have worked. My mom is a fighter and I knew she would overcome this awful disease yet again. I am proud to say that my mother is CANCER FREE!! There is still a test or two left to determine the remainder of her treatment and recovery but at least we can say that she is cancer free right now. We have beaten this truly awful disease and will continue to do so until her 5 year anniversary mark. I can’t begin to thank each and every one of you who have supported my family and me through this time. I can’t even imagine that my mom was actually diagnosed at the beginning of the year where has the time gone? It’s already July. All of the prayers and kind messages have been amazing. My mom takes each one to heart and let me tell you she spares any amount of time to tell me about each and every single one! Thankfully we are on our last step of recovery and while I know my mom is in a world of pain right now she will do her best to knock this out and get on to the next part of her journey. As I\\'m sure we all want to see especially Stasi and me. I know I have thanked everyone a lot but it just really means so much to me to see all this support for my mother. I don’t believe we could have got through this without all of your support. Our bills are certainly not over nowhere near but at least we can say that my mom is once again cancer free! + Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Jordan Scott 20 months ago Share Tomorrow is the day the day that has seemed like it would never come. Finally the day of my mother’s surgery. I have to say I\\'ve tried my hardest to stay calm and strong but this is very tough. They told us that her surgery when it is all said and done will be around 10 hours with three different surgeons participating. I know my mom is strong. I know that my mom will be glad to wake up from the surgery and that portion will be over and behind us. I\\'m very worried for my little sister as I know her mind will be racing in that waiting room. This will now be our second attempt at getting rid of this awful breast cancer and this time around it’s going to be extremely hard. What also makes me really upset is that my mother is going to have to spend her birthday (The 30th) in a hospital bed. Hopefully we can find a way to make it extra special. If anyone wants to give my mother a present please let it be to have her be cancer free when it comes time to see the pathology report. Again I want to thank every one of you for all the continued prayers and support for my mom. If anyone would like to help to continue to support my mom and my family please click the link. Any amount regardless of the size is more than appreciated. I just want everyone to know that this has been very tough as we have all the bills from Emory University and now MD Anderson. Rest assured that every single penny of your donation is going straight to her medical bills. With all of your support we have been able to meet our deductible which is now allowing us to work on paying 40% of the bill which is our out of pocket expense which is 25000 due to the fact that we are out here in Texas. Regardless it’s much better than the 100% before the deductible. This support means the world to us. Again it only takes a second to click the link and read throughout our journey as I\\'ve tried my hardest to keep everyone up to date with everything that has gone on throughout this very long and stressful process. + Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Jordan Scott 20 months ago Share This journey has been both mentally and physically challenging for all of my family and I. Between worrying about my little sister and how she is handling it all and let me tell you my mother is a good teacher because I really can’t tell how she is taking all of this in. My mom who has just.... well been through it all being a single mom raising 2 children in Miami to 3 different types of cancer. After hearing the news that the first surgery had failed I felt so bad for my mom. To think this all could have been over months ago. To now basically starting all over. I couldn’t be more proud of the way she has been handling herself. It is admirable to watch how she handles each and every appointment and test and manages to keep everything straight and be the best advocate for herself I am beyond impressed.We are about to enter what will probably be one of the toughest times for my family and I. To catch everyone up we have all our information and let me tell you it’s a lot of information. How my mom keeps it all straight is beyond me. Her surgery is on June 28th and will consist of three different surgeons in the room for about ten hours. For anyone who has had to deal with medical issues I\\'m sure you can assume how serious this surgery is and how very nerve racking it is. It also pains me to say that her surgery falls at the time my mother will be in a hospital bed at MD Anderson Hospital recovering on the day of her birthday. My mom’s birthday is June 30th for anyone who was curious as well as my little sister Stasi’s birthday is on the 25 of June. As I mentioned the surgery will be roughly ten hours. It is going to be a crazy day. As I said it’s only my sister and I who is only turning 14. I just can’t imagine how tough it is going to be for her. Having to wait in that waiting room for that amount of time what could possibly be going through her head? On top of all of that it is only the two of us that will be taking care of my mom and that means all the care cleaning errands all the meals and most importantly my mother’s medical care which will be extremely tough to handle. The physical part of accomplishing all of this is tough enough with what we have but emotionally will be one of the hardest things that we will have to endure in our lives. Having a strong mental fortitude is tough and it’s something my mom taught me at a young age but this experience has shown me how tough it truly is to keep that strength up. I want to say thank you to everyone who has helped support my mom all of her friends and family. As well as my personal friends it really means a lot. All of the support text messages and phone calls everything has just been what we needed to help us during this time. We are finally to the toughest part of the journey and I have to say I\\'m afraid. For anyone who knows me I don’t show my emotions very well and if I do it’s still pretty walled off. I have to say I haven\\'t been perfect through this whole thing the other day I broke down and had one of those full body cries. Let me tell you it’s been a long while since that has happened and wow.. I felt like a truck hit me. That was definitely something that woke me back up and got my mind right again. My mom will have a long recovery time and for many weeks she won’t really be able to do anything at all. This will be a very tough time for us and I can’t even imagine what is going on in her head. I feel that this go fund me is great to express feelings and be able to see all the love and support we get back really keeps us strong. My mom loves the messages she gets and is amazed and grateful when a complete stranger reaches out and sends a messages or donates it really does touch her heart. All I can ask is please keep the love flowing. The messages the comments the phone calls and the donations have kept us going. I have to say as I\\'ve said in previous updates my mom hates to ask for anything and I mean anything. But I understand our financial situation and between the bills from Emory Hospital that we are still responsible for to all of the new bills that will arrive from MD Anderson Hospital it will be overwhelming. I just want to assure everyone that all donations are strictly going to medical bills only. So from the bottom of my heart I’d like to thank everyone who has supported us and for anyone who would like to continue to help us we are so grateful for your continued donations. Whatever you feel that you can is greatly appreciated and If that is not possible then I ask you to please share to others. Each person has their own set of friends and perhaps someone will read our story and it will touch them. Regardless I thank you all for taking the time to read our story and that I know you will be thinking of my mom on the 28th of June sending love positive thoughts and asking for her safety to return to us. With love Thank you from my family and I. + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Jordan Scott 21 months ago Share Hello everyone This has been a very hectic time for my family and I. The move to Houston Texas was a rather hard challenge and it has only got tougher since we got here. I can only start by saying that regardless of all these tough times I couldn\\'t be happier that we decided to go to MD Anderson. I want to thank everyone who has contributed to help my mother and everyone who has continued to call and text my mother and I for constant updates on her condition. It really means a lot. Our trip was long the drive was bumpy let me tell you some of these Texas roads are very scary. We arrived on Labor day which had its set of challenges to start with The Houston traffic is .... rough to say the least. For our Georgia friends I have to say I think i\\'ve grown accustom to Georgia lifestyle aka the Georgia wave as I like to call it. Going throughout our building its been rather comical waving to people or stopping to say hello and in return getting some weird stare and them walking away. I quickly remembered what the city was like and had to adapt. Moving in to the place was beyond hilarious the look on my face after asking the leasing office if they had a hand cart or dolly to help with the move and the response was a straight faced .... \"\"no\"\" So that was about 20-30 trips back and forth of moving from one end of the apartment to the other. On a positive note Md Anderson has been worlds different than Emory. The term Rag Doll comes to mind for the last few days. Md Anderson is very different they focus on your entire being at this hospital from your mind to your diet to even meditation. I believe from our first appointment we have had upwards of 15 or more appointments that we have gone through. I have to tell you all that my mother has been a trooper. Through all the tests that they have done to the nutrition and to just the sheer amount of information she has to retain she has done amazing. The hospital is huge you all should see the list of instructions they give to get from place to place they are massive! Starting bright and early for 3 days in a row we left the place at 6:30 am and went to as late as 5 or 6 pm each day completely filled with consults and test and blood work. During one of the first rounds of testing a mass was discovered in the left breast. This had never been there previously. A surgical biopsy was performed and we are awaiting confirmation on the pathology. Additionally there is now a mention of calcification\\'s in the right breast. This had never been mentioned since my original diagnosis in January. Follow up is needed to learn more prior to surgery. So we are still awaiting a few important results and will update as soon as we can. To get to the point that I believe most of you are wondering about. We have chose her surgery and her reconstructive surgery type. The earliest time we can get is June 22nd but more than likely her surgery will be around the June 29th or the first week of July. I\\'d appreciate if you could please for my mom keep her in mind in hopes that we can get that surgery on the soonest possible date as this will allow myself and my sister to be here with her and available to help her. We are very close to reaching are deductible within approximately 950.00. This is because of the percentage that go fund me take out for providing the service. After we hit this target we are now going to work on the maximum out of pocket which is 25000.00 we are responsible to pay 40 percent of all bill after the deductible up to that amount. It is 40 percent due to the fact that we are in network but out of state it would have been 30 percent. The price of 10 percent is well worth the care that you get at this number one ranked cancer hospital in America. So please keep that in mind as to why we need to continue to reach out and ask for donations. Again Id like to apologize for taking so long to write another update. We have all been so exhausted not to mention a lovely run in with a million ants in this place has been extremely fun! But to wrap everything up I\\'d like to say that everything is well ... or as well as it can be and that we are progressing as quick as we can. I really do appreciate anyone and everyone who contributes our bills are just stacking and stacking I can\\'t begin to tell you all how expensive this really is. So with that being said I really do want to thank anyone and everyone who has contributed or will contribute for a first time. It means more than I can explain in words. I will post again as soon as we are updated with a confirmed surgery date. Please r ember to share and pass this page to anyone you feel might be able to help. Thank you From all of us. + Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 517 shares on Facebook Read a Previous UpdatePrevious update You\\'re on update 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Next update\"',\n",

She is hitting another make or break moment in this journey with her lymphoma. Cari was moved once again from a rehab facility and is back at Kaiser hospital in Hollywood. The cancer is growing and affecting her kidney function. In order to get through this next set of challenges she is going to need additional treatments outside her medical coverage as our government representatives continue to waste time debating if all people deserve good medical care or just elected officials. I\\'m going back to the well of your kindness to see if together we can help keep Cari afloat as she moves steadily but slowly toward her goal of a bone marrow transplant at City of Hope. These moments make it so clear that it does indeed take a village. Thank you for rallying to help one of the kindest humans on the planet. Your generosity is much appreciated.

This will be the start of her fourth round. Can't believe how fast time is going by here! Em is doing so well. She did her swallow study and passed so she is now eating solids and drinking again. She is still on her feeding tube. She will have to eventually work her way up to just eating solids again. Then we can stop the feeding tube. ENT will be doing a scope soon to see how her vocal cords are looking. She has also gained some weight. She is two pounds away from her pre-diagnosis weight. Which is great! + Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Shemeal Khan 24 months ago Share 11 Great update on Emily!!! She is such a strong little girl.March 6 2016By Christy Navarra — 2 hours agoWe got to see Em's MRI results yesterday. We saw what we wanted to see! Everything is shrinking! Thank god. Hopefully her progress continues. We also found out that her blood clot in her heart is gone. Somehow within the last week it dissolved. So hopefully we will stop the blood thinning meds soon. Everything is going well with her third round of chemo so far and hopefully she continues to do well. She is a trooper!March 3 2016By Christy Navarra — Mar 3 2016 6:59pmEm had her MRI today. Tomorrow we should get the results to see how chemo is affecting the tumors so far. Physical therapy came by earlier today and was working with her on walking. She did really well! They were impressed with her progress. Pretty soon she will be up and running around!March 1 2016By Christy Navarra — Mar 1 2016 12:59pmSorry for not updating yesterday. It was a busy day. Em got her g-tube put in. Everything went well and she is having no issues at all with it so far. She was pretty sleepy and out of it yesterday from the sedation so she didn't get to do much. We found out during her hearing test that the tumor before it was removed was also pressing on the nerves in her ear. So it is likely that she may have to get a hearing aid eventually as ear nerves don't typically come back. Her hearing in that ear is pretty much gone. Good news is it won't affect her development or speech and her right ear is in perfect condition. So at least she has one perfectly functioning ear. They are keeping a close eye on the functioning ear to make sure it isn't compromised during treatment in the least bitFebruary 28 2016By Christy Navarra — Feb 28 2016 7:40pmToday was a quiet day. Em did get to go outside though for the first time in months. She had an absolute blast! The weather was perfect too. Tomorrow she will get her G-Tube put in and then will have no more feeding tube in her nose! + Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Shemeal Khan 24 months ago ShareFebruary 24 2016By Christy Navarra — Feb 24 2016 12:19pmEm has had a productive day! Speech therapy came by and tried a speaking valve on Emily today. This is a little piece they put on the end of her trach to help her speak using her own vocal cords. In order to do that they have to deflate her trach which means she would have to first breathe on her own through her vocal cords. Usually the first time kids try the valve they can do up to a minute or so. Em did it for 10 minutes and was still at 100% oxygen the whole time. That is really good. It is tiring though since you are breathing in a way that you havent been for a while. They think her vocal cords are definitely coming back so we will keep working with them to strengthen her speech and eventually work on eating solid foods again. Today we are doing a dose of chemo so hopefully all goes well with that. We have scans scheduled for next week to see how the tumors are responding to treatment. Oh and.....This morning I looked over and saw this! She sat up all by herself. This is a giant step for her! Go Em!+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Shemeal Khan 24 months ago Share I'm so sorry for the delay in updating!! Thank you Christy for letting everyone know how Emily is doing. We are all continuing to pray for your family!!February 22 2016By Christy Navarra — 6 hours agoToday we found out some good news! Emily's blood clot is smaller than it was last week so that means her body is breaking it up which is exactly what we wanted it to do. She will continue on the blood thinning medicine and hopefully heart surgery can be completely avoided and eventually she will be clot free. This of course could take a few months. Em's doctors have recommended that she get a G-tube placed so that she does not have to have a feeding tube in her nose anymore. This will be a tube placed in her stomach. As long as her counts are ok she will be getting one put in on Thursday. When she tries to talk we can hear her talking with the trach in which is a good sign. They will be re-evaluating her vocal cords soon to see if they are functioning at all again. All in all she is making good progress!February 19 2016By Christy Navarra — Feb 19 2016 3:16pmToday was a fun day! We did some occupational therapy physical therapy and speech therapy.

He is on pretty much every waiting list we could find as far as cancer centers or apartments that's involved with M D Anderson. Desperately need him staying the whole 21 days after treatment in Houston. This is to decrease the spreading of infection. We've learned that it's a for sure thing he will get sick. There isn't anything that we can do besides keep him closer to MD for the fastest & best possible infectious disease care. As you can imagine staying in a hotel for 21 days can be quite pricey. There are some hotels that can will cut a deal but it isn't nearly enough of a cut. If anyone knows of a place please message - text -call me. He really wants to get this over with before Christmas. It would be awful to in a hospital during the holidays.+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Kayla Mire 17 months ago Share Thank you all for the prayers. Andy is doing much better. The nurses were saying you wouldn't think he was in the ICU a few days ago. God is good! Should be coming home very soon+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Kayla Mire 17 months ago Share Asking everyone to please lift Andy up in your prayers. He was admitted into the hospital this past Saturday with a high fever and has been in ICU since early this morning. They found streptococcus in his blood again. This caused an infection in his PICC line. So they had this removed and put another one in his other arm. He is on multiple antibiotics. They are having a hard time getting his oxygen levels right. Also they found a blood clot in his arm that was infected. He has pneumonia. They've been working on breathing exercises. Just a few days ago he began to hallucinate due to a medication that they give him for viral infections. He has not gotten much sleep. We do not know right now how long he's going to be at MD Anderson. We did find out that since this is reoccurring his previous treatment for the same bacteria was not treated as long as it should have been. I will keep this up to date with any new information until he is discharged+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Kayla Mire 19 months ago Share Hi Everyone! Been a while since I've updated so I am just going to tell you whats been going on lately. During Andy's 3rd recovery from treatment he contracted quite a few infections rhino virus & pneumonia.. He has been in the hospital for close to two weeks. We had started out at Rapides thinking he was running a fever because he's levels were coming up. Not the case at all. After 2 days fighting to get him transferred to MD Anderson they FINALLY got him on an ambulance. We got there they started him on some hard core meds to control the fever. Ran a ton test xrays ct scans. They had to give him blood and platelet transfusion which did not go well the first couple of times he had some reactions. Not from the transfusions ... but his body was fighting off the good stuff basically. He is still in Houston currently. Hopefully he will be able to come home soon. They are pushing back his next treatment so he can continue to recover from all the infections. BUT good news he should only have about 2 more rounds. Fingers crossed. We would like to thank everyone who has shown so much support during this time. It is not easy for him or our little family to be apart. Please continue to keep him in your thoughts & prayers. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 1 Posted by Marianne Bullock 40 months ago Share Here is an update on Titus -- please donate and help make these last months together a little gentler financially. No one should be fighting w insurance companies or worrying about paying the bills while going through this. Titus was diagnosed with AML at 5 mos old. He went into his first remission at 9 months. He relapsed at 14 mos. He remissioned again and then had his Bone Marrow / Stem cell transplant at 17 mos. he is now 21 mos and @ 180 days post transplant he has again relapsed.Our team has informed us with AML relapse after transplant there is no standard form of treatment. Any trials have only been tested in Rats and on a couple adults. And they also only come in pill form which can\\'t be crushed. So that\\'s out of the question for Titus.We\\'ve been given two options. We can either let Titus be happy and really enjoy the time he has left which they said would be a few weeks to a month or we can do a low dose chemo which will prolong his life a month or two longer. And we could potentially make it through the holidays.So we chose the low dose chemo.Which is called Vidasa.We are asking for you all to please just pray for a \"\" Christmas Miracle\"\" as my cousin Shana put it. Please feel free to post on here don\\'t be afraid. Also feel free to inbox us with any questions.

       " '\"Update 4 Posted by Monica Nachtigal 13 months ago Share Sweet Paige Pesko ends her chemotherapy treatments this week. That tumor? They took a peek at it not long ago and couldn’t see it. That’s how responsive her cancer is to treatment. The regularity of chemo treatments has been something Paige can count on and that they’re ending is making her uneasy. Of course she’s ready for her hair eyelashes and eyebrows to grow back. But she has 3 surgeries ahead the first one on Valentine’s Day. They’re going to remove some lymph nodes and determine if she needs radiation. Paige has a genetic predisposition for the return of cancer which she writes about in her blog (linked below.) Because of this she’ll also need a full hysterectomy this year. It’s more hardship than the young couple deserves. A big gracious thank you goes out to all who donated to our fundraiser for Paige. Your money has not been wasted. Paige hasn’t been working for 4 months and isn’t sure when she will be able to again. Also - the insurance company says that Paige will only need screenings every three months where her doctors will want to screen more often. This money will help the young couple make ends meet and it will pay a portion of those cancer screenings in the year ahead. Remember your Facebook shares of Paige’s story are helpful too!Paige\\'s blog is here. newmommybigc.blogspot.com+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Monica Nachtigal 16 months ago Share Paige\\'s first treatment was easy she was hopeful that the weeks ahead would be a breeze. The second treatment happened yesterday and was followed by an afternoon of nausea. She woke up this morning and saw a pale sick person in the mirror. That nausea has passed but she found that her hair is already falling out. Paige boldly shaved that head two weeks ago but it\\'s still hard facing that reality of chemotherapy treatment. We hope the chemo is working as quickly on that tumor. She has an appointment this week to see if it\\'s being affected. Please keep Paige in your prayers.The money we\\'ve raised through this campaign is helping Paige focus on the new baby and on staying strong through cancer treatment. The Peskos had dreams for the future that were put on hold after her diagnosis. Paige will keep driving the old car with its expensive new alternator. Andrew will carefully use his remaining couple vacation days until next spring when he\\'ll get more. Every penny raised here is building an important safety net for Paige Andrew and Baby Ben. The bills for treatment have only started to arrive. Yes we\\'ve met our goal and exceeded our expectations through this campaign. But I\\'m secretly hoping we can push this total to $10000. Thank you for following and sharing Paige\\'s story. Relaxing after her second round of chemo+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Monica Nachtigal 16 months ago Share Paige isn\\'t going to let chemotherapy take her hair she and her husband both shaved their heads on her very first day of treatment. She tells me that she feels pretty good and isn\\'t sure if the fatigue is due to chemo or the newborn in the house. She had a port placed in her right arm and that\\'s giving her more trouble than any chemo side-effects but it\\'s still healing.Baby Benjamin is a dream baby he\\'s quiet and easy-going. Andrew her husband keeps Paige positive and has been tremendous support. She said that she had planned to breastfeed the baby but those plans were canceled when she got the cancer diagnosis. The young couple will be buying formula that wasn\\'t in the plan. Paige tells me she\\'s humbled by your love and support. This has been the most terrifying time in her life. The outpouring of love and donations from near and far make her feel less alone. If you can\\'t spare the cash to donate your Facebook share is also very valuable. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Monica Nachtigal 17 months ago Share 22 Paige tells me that she starts 16 - 20 weeks of chemo tomorrow (Friday.) During chemotherapy she\\'ll have to keep a distance from Benny as he\\'s given some of his vaccinations because they could make her sick. The funds we\\'ve raised here are a blessing for Paige because she likely have to stay away from work for longer than expected. Paige and Andrew were expecting to pay for a baby delivery but the cost of cancer treatments are a big surprise. For this reason I\\'m going to \"\"up\"\" the goal for this campaign. The great news is that her doctor gives her a very promising prognosis. Paige is young and strong and she hopes to keep running during treatment. It keeps her body strong and her mind busy.I want to give a warm THANK YOU to each and every person who has donated to this campaign.

Our journey in California looking for a treatment has ended. We are headed back to Pennsylvania in hopes of getting into a new immunotherapy trial in Maryland. We are going to travel and see they country for two weeks. We plan on leaving July 15th. Her tumors in her lung and growing and there was also new growth. Please pray for a miracle for my baby girl. + Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Amber Griffin 35 months ago Share So unfortunately ot.looks like bone cancer came.back in Nevaehs leg in two spots. They are coming in today (the whole team) to talk about it. They want to do bone biopsy but if.they are 90%sure it is what it is we are not doing biopsy and just want to amputate. We dont want her to.be in pain just to have it removed. I seen the x ray and I myself had looked at my daughters scans and.researched this cancer for a entire year. I no it is local reaccurant osteosarcoma. I feel.like a horrible.mom because we did not chose to amputate in the first place. Nevaeh on the other hand is thrilled to have he leg off she never has fully had a normal walk most likr because of the tumor eing around.her knee. I dont no how this was missed.in January. It maybe just has grew this much since then. We dont no. But she will most likely have above knee amputation. So please pray for good news. I am.just so scared they will tell me today that surgery wont be worth it be disease will spread and.chemo.does.not work for her. They will put her on a chemo pill after she heals from.her.leg surgery. Why my baby why this almost incurable cancer. I am just ao destroyed by this news.+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Amber Griffin 36 months ago Share Ok guys so.I no long post suck but I no you all are wondering about our second opinion on hyperthermia and radiation... welll here goes ... we got a email from a friend about a great hypertheria clinic. We turned around on our way to bircher and went to get a second opinion. We have had a odd feeling about bircher since we arrived but when thats all the hope you have to save your baby you do what you have to do. They had review her scans and concluded that neither their hyperthermia or bircher cancer institute will take away her.tumors in her lungs. If it reoccued in.her leg or spine or any other place but her lung hyperthermia would workd but aince it was in her lungs her ribs would be receiving all the hyperthermia and radiation. We were devistated. But miraculously we happen to be in the same 8 story building in santa monica as a great sarcoma doctor! People.fly from all.over the world to see dr.chawla. he has access to the newest trials he has worked with sarcoma for 30 years ahe worked at md anderson and worked specifically with osteo for 10 years. The hyperthermia dr walked us down to see him and.they saw.us right then.right there. What are the chances of us getting a second opinion and they cant help us and then finding out one of the best dr.in sarcoma are right below us . We had a long talk and he feels he has a treatment that will work. Its ifosfamide but not the way most hospitals administer it. Not in high dose which is bad for bone marrow. Its on drip that she will be on for 2 weeks on 2 weeks off then 2 weeks on 2 weeks off no hospital stays or anything. Then they will do a scan to see if tumors have stopped growing then will do surgery followed by same prior.to surgery protocol. I talk to dr maurer today at chp and he cant offer that protocal at pittsburgh. He is.looking.into this treatment for her.before we make a decision. But he thinks so far it a good idea. She only weighs 44 lbs and cant take high dose anything anymore. So more good news even.with all her go fund me.money in our bank they still approved her for medi cal . Bc thus treatment and surgery will cost hundred of thousands ... and now with the go fund me and benefits we are able to live her while treatment is happening and not have to wirry about us working and most importantly spending time as a family and enjoy nevaehs company every second of the day. They will do scan before surgery to see if chemo is working. And if not we are driving straight home to be with family. But dr chawla truly believes he can help her. I want to thank everyone who is praying for her. I want to thank everyone who donated clothes money and time putting her benefits together for her its helping us afford to live in this crazy expensive place and most of importantly not stressing about non important things and being a family thank all of you from them bottom of my heart god bless you all I think everything happens for a reason.

       " '\"Update 5 Posted by Katherine Bakich 4 months ago Share October 12 2017. It\\'s been about one year since Ashley\\'s last update. We thought it would be good to let everyone know how she is doing. It was about this time last year that she went into cardiac arrest. She received an implanted defibrillator and was up and resumed normal activities pretty quickly. She took a leave of absence from teaching for most of last school year. This year she decided to stay home and focus on her health and just enjoy her family . Her chemotherapy was tweaked after her cardiac event and for almost a year things have been calm for her.Late this summer Ashley began to feel the effects of her diagnosis. She was experiencing fatigue nausea and unexplained pain in her abdomen and back. After struggling with the discomfort for months Mike and Ashley went to Emory for some answers. New scans revealed that one of her tumors is growing faster than the others and is pressing on a nerve which is causing the pain and discomfort. After a few days in the hospital she was sent home with a new treatment plan. She will fly to Tampa for 3 weeks of weekday radiation (weekends off). This is to shrink the large tumor and hopefully relieve some of the symptoms she has been feeling. After she completes the radiation she is hoping to get into a clinical trial that could buy her more \"\"time off\"\" of chemo.This is the most recent plan and obviously much of this is uncertain and can change quickly. Ashley is so thankful and appreciative of the love and support she has been shown through this whole ordeal. She continues to be amazed by family friends strangers acquaintances and everyone who has contributed to her family during this time. Anything you give goes directly to Ashley and her family. She is so grateful for the community that has stepped up and made this difficult time less of a financial burden for them. So far the funds raised have paid for medical deductibles medications flights to/from Tampa\\'s Moffitt Cancer Center gas money for doctors appointments at Emory...and in general have kept their household running. Please continue to give as you wish and most importantly keep Ashley in your thoughts and prayers.+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Katherine Bakich 15 months ago Share 11 An update from Trisha Collier:Friday October 14 2016 will be a day that I never forget much less a day that Ashley Taube will ever forget. It was a typical Friday for Ashley she headed to Starbucks to pick up her mobile order for her and her husband Mike. (Side note: Mike is the school’s athletic trainer and she is the competition cheerleading coach. ) She dropped his coffee to him and headed back up to the main building stopping in the mailroom to retrieve some copies for her classes. She entered the mail room and ran into our school nurse Candy Flemming. It was while they were talking that Ashley went into cardiac arrest.Ashley collapsed right in front of Candy. She fell face first hit her head on a trashcan and began seizing right in front of our school nurse. Candy checked for a pulse and Ashley was not breathing at this point. She immediately began life saving CPR. She radioed for someone to call 911 and Mike Taube the school athletic trainer was contacted at the field house and his presence was requested to the mail room to help a fallen student. Candy never identified who had collapsed but everyone that entered the mail room saw the cheerleading back pack attached to the patient who happened to be the cheer coach and not a cheerleader. Mike raced to the mail room prepared to help a student in need and instead of seeing a student lying on the ground he walked into a situation where his wife was on the floor. I CAN NOT even imagine what went through his mind at this time. However he went into Mike the Trainer mode and he began mouth to mouth on his wife and Candy continued the compressions. 2 CPR cycles were being issued while the AED was being set up to shock Ashley’s heart. The AED told them to perform one more round of CPR and then finally her heart was beating appropriately and Ashley was breathing. At this time the paramedics had arrived and had taken over. Ashley was responsive and was whisked away on a stretcher on the ambulance and taken to Gwinnett Medical Center. The administrative staff at Mill Creek was amazing throughout this time as they kept calm in a school of 3800 students and eliminated as many rumors about a beloved teacher/coach as they could.Ashley is a healthy 35 year old woman who has seemed to do everything right. She loves being a mom wife teacher coach and a friend. She loves life and life loves her as you can tell by the thousands of people who are constantly touched by her presence. I’ve watched a best friend suffer and pretty much lose her life and regain it in a few minutes. To me it is obvious that God has special plans for Ashley and her family. It is not her time to go and He has made that clear. However as we all know that God’s timing is….God’s timing. We have to be patient and we have to keep our eyes and ears open. Ashley is doing just that and I am so proud of her for listening to Him and taking the time to hear what He is saying to her. There is a reason she is still here and she has to figure it out. It could take a year it could take 6 months it could a week for her to figure it out. But I want her to have the TIME to figure it out. I don’t want her to stress about what lesson she is teaching her class or how she is going to get her class covered so she can attend an event at her child’s school. I want her to do whatever she damn well pleases to do. I don’t want her job to be an issue I don’t want money to be an issue and I don’t want her health to be an issue. I want her to be able to live her life and be content. We can’t predict the future and no one can state how much time we have here on Earth. But if we can control one thing that is how we live our life here on Earth. Ashley makes everyone that she comes into contact with a better person. So I’m writing this and updating complete strangers on her life because I believe in her and I believe God has a special plan for her in this place we call life. My hope is to share her story and to help other people who are struggling with daily battles fight for their life and not give up when maybe you aren’t dealt the hand you wanted. I hope people will pray for the Taube’s and pray for their strength. I hope that anyone who can help them out financially will be led to donate any amount possible. Most of all I pray that people will be inspired by Ashley Taube and that her story will be passed on and on to all of those people in need. She truly is an inspiration to me and to all people that come in contact with her or her story. I love you Ashley and thankful God brought you into my life almost 12.5 years ago. I’d like to share a quote that Ashley shared with me through one of her many fashion statements:“You never know how STRONG you are until STRONG is your only option.”(please read previous update for Ashley\\'s version of events)+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Katherine Bakich 15 months ago Share This is an excerpt from Ashley Taube’s blog ( www.jointeamtaube.com):\"\"Good Lord it has been a roller coaster of emotions lately! I guess that is all to be expected. Remember that time my heart stopped?! Yeah- that was a bit stressful! While I was in the hospital the doctors were trying tofigure out the best game plan for me…the first decision was to pause my chemo round. I was in the middle of round 8 but my oncologist in Tampa felt the best choice was to take a pause figure out my heart and then we’d move forward with tumor treatment. So the next plan was for me to get fitted for a Life Vest. This thing was basically a portable AED that was strapped to my chest…like a bomb. It had a chord attached to it that attached to a 90s looking car-phone type battery pack that I had to carry around like a purse. Uhhh…what?! Oh and it had to go on under everything…even my bra. Uhh…how is this supposed to be conducive to my lifestyle? So I wore it for a full 24 hours when my doctor decided this isn’t the best way to go…I needed surgery to have an ICD implanted. (ICD= Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) I had the surgery on Tuesday 4 days after I fell out and I was released from the hospital the next day. Now I have my own portable AED/pacemaker/defibrillator that goes with me everywhere! It’s almost as if I got an implant on one side…unfortunately the doctor couldn’t do both sides and help a sister out but it is what it is. The earliest I would be allowed to work again was a week away but I was ready. I was ready to go back to normal and live my life! I got to come home from the hospital on Fischer’s birthday and celebrate him turning 5 with all of my family…perfect! We were still organizing the details for his birthday party that weekend and all the while I was planning to return to work in a week. Then we got word that I would start my chemo round again with a different regime but it would begin on Monday and end on Friday. As in the Monday before I would return to work on Wednesday…hmmm…well that doesn’t seem like ideal circumstances to returning to work…BUT I got it! I got this! Hear me roar! Okay let me figure out logistics…I can’t shower for 2 weeks (because of surgery)…I can’t drive or even ride in the front seat for 2 weeks (because my implant can’t risk getting blasted by an Airbag going off)…I can’t raise my left arm and have to wear this odd brace/tie down around my waist…and I still feel like a complete and utter moron from all the anesthesia and meds I’ve been on (I’m hoping it’s from the meds and I’m not morphing into an idiot)…but it’s okay…I’m going back to work…after cardiac arrest…and being on chemo…Right so Mike and I had a chat. A few chats because I still had some amnesia and didn’t remember all of our chats. We decided I needed some time and I didn’t need to rush back to work. This is why we have benefits so if you need them you take them. I think it’s safe to say that I need them. I need some time to rest and try to get as healthy as possible. My mom was SO relieved…and so was my friend Trisha! They definitely wanted me to take the time and it turns out that my mom’s job gave her some time off too so she could stay with me and look after me. Mike went back to work after taking an entire week off and missing TWO football games…yes TWO…can you believe that?! He really does love me! Proof is in the puddin’! Mom has been chauffeuring me around and helping me get the kids ready and to school. We have had so much fun that if this is what it’s like to be a stay at home mom then sign me up! I mean mom and I have just been hanging out running errands spending time with my boys laughing resting when I get worn out andshe’s been doing our laundry. Clearly this is not what “Stay at home mom” life would always look like but it sure looks good right now!In all seriousness what my take away from this moment in time is that I’m thankful. I’m so thankful that I am alive! I’m so thankful that I have this time with my mom my husband my boys my family. Damn life is easy to take for granted…you just never know what is going to happen…but I tell you what I am thankful to have this time. My sorority sister told me that her neighbor is an ER Dr. who is a resuscitation scientist and he said that only 10% of people that go into cardiac arrest survive. 10%! That’s it! That’s terrifying! So while I certainly have my moments of “why does this dramatic stuff keep happening to me?!” I also feel like “if God were trying to kill me off he’s had plenty of opportunities and I’m still ticking!” He must have something great planned for me and while I’m on this break I am praying for guidance. I hope that he helps me find my path so I can do all the great things I’m supposed to do. I have felt SO MUCH love from my family friends school community and cheerleading world. So today on this quiet Saturday morning I am going to just allow myself to be thankful and grateful that I am a part of this great place we call life. We don’t have to have all the answers today…but we can be thankful we’re here to try and find them. \"\"Update on Ashleypost cardiac-arrest+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Katherine Bakich 23 months ago Share In early March Ashley and Mike went to Tampa to the Moffitt Cancer Center to meet with a doctor who specializes in neuroendocrine tumors. Upon this visit the specialist recommended the same treatment that Emory did but wanted to do a couple of scans to give him some baseline data. Two weeks later Ashley and Mike flew back down to Tampa to have a 3 phase CT scan and meet with the doctor again to nail down the chemo treatment plan. The scan gave him some helpful baseline data and treatment would begin the next day.The plan is to do 3 rounds of chemo then return to Tampa for another CT scan to ensure the tumor is shrinking. If the tumor has shrunk enough and has not spread elsewhere then radiation may be a possibility at that point. If the tumor has not shrunk enough and/or has spread then more rounds of chemo will be the plan. The chemo treatment entails taking pills for 14 days. The first chemo drug is 2 pills after breakfast and 2 pills after dinner and that is taken for 14 days straight. The 2nd chemo drug is taken on the last 5 days of the 14 days and is taken in addition to the 1st chemo drug. This drug is a bit stronger and is 3 pills before bedtime. An additional drug is taken before the 2nd chemo drug to help combat some of the nausea side effects. The typical side effects of this treatment are fatigue nausea and diarrhea. Fortunately a side effect is not hair loss so Ashley is very thankful for that.Ashley began her first round of chemo in March and she will go back to Tampa in April to do blood work and ensure her platelet levels are high enough to handle further treatment. The first round was challenging and she certainly felt the nausea and fatigue as she got further and further into the round. She was able to continue working which she was excited about and her students and colleagues were helpful and supportive. She just had to cut back on anything outside of teaching. The aftermath of the first round lingered a few days past being finished with her first round but that was to be expected.Next up is another quick trip to Tampa in mid-April and then begin round 2 of chemo. After the third round they will go back to Tampa to decide if radiation is a possibility or if more rounds of chemo are necessary. The best scenario would be that the treatment shrinks the tumor enough (and it hasn’t spread to another organ) that radiation is an option to temporarily eliminate the tumor all together. It will come back as neuroendocrine cancer is not curable but this would at least give some time off of treatment.What does she need? Meals are not super helpful right now because they are so busy and not home often enough. Local friends are kind enough to invite the Taubes on play dates which gives the boys something fun to do and Ashley some social time. On the first chemo round she had a terrible metallic taste in her mouth and often felt nauseous so meals might end up unfortunately being wasted rather than enjoyed. Prayers are always welcomed and positive thoughts are appreciated! This Go Fund Me has been a huge blessing as it has helped with medical bills traveling etc. People are so kind to offer childcare but if you know Ashley and Mike then you know they really enjoy having their children with them as often as they can. The boys are a bright light to all of these hard times and Ashley enjoys their positive energy and joy. Someone in their wonderful community has started a t-shirt campaign to help support her and her family. If you are interested in getting a Team Taube t-shirt then you can go to www.jointeamtaube.com.Ashley and Mike are both amazed by the love and support that everyone has shown them and are thankful every day for all the great things in their lives. Yes this is a tough road that they are on but the outlook is good. While yes her cancer is not curable (yet) and is inoperable she is thankful that it is treatable. She continues to stay positive and knows that is the best way to fight. Thank you for your continued support! + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Jim had a scan last week which came back clear except one lymph node. This node has continued to grow and is resistant to the current chemo. Jim's doctors have decided to change his treatment plan slightly. Starting this Monday Jim will be admitted to the hospital to receive a very intense round of chemo. Please pray for Jim and help uplift his family with encouraging words. If you are able to donate or know of anyone who would like to donate to the Tollett family please share this link with them. Also if anyone has connections with Jim's church and could have this page shared in a church bulletin it would be greatly appreciated. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Donations for tickets will be accepted until 5pm!+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Michael Newman O'Connor 22 months ago ShareUPDATE! SCALE MODEL GUITARS IS OFFERING THE OPPRTUNITY TO OWN THIS ONE OF A KIND HANDMADE GUITAR (read full post for details!)or go to SMG here: http://scalemodelguitars.com/Battle_Tapes_Guitar.htmlSee the following from Dave@SMG for details!Battle Tapes GuitarOn April 17th 2016 our friend Candice Burnside Ferguson lost her fight with breast cancer leaving behind her husband Jeremy and their 16-month old daughter Exie. She was 37 years old. Candice was a staple of our local music community co-owner of Battle Tapes Recording and to those of us who were lucky enough to have had the chance to get to know her she was also a remarkable human being. It is always heartbreaking when we loose someone to this terrible disease but it is especially difficult when a young family is involved. Back in 1992 I lost my mother to cancer and I still think about her every day. It was such a difficult time for my family and if it weren’t for the support of our extended family and friends I don’t know how I could have dealt with the situation at such a young age..I will always remember the generosity of others and the strength that they gave me through their support back then. None of us can do anything to change the situation but we do have control over our response to it. At this time we need to try and help the Ferguson’s in any way that we are able to.There has been such a tremendous outpouring of support for the Ferguson’s within our local community several benefit shows and a GoFundMe page raising funds to ease the burden of their medical expenses. Watching all of these people in our community rally around friends who are in a tough spot shouldn’t be a suprise that is just what we do..we get each other’s backs when one of us needs help.The guitar that you see pictured above is SMG #61. It was completed last year and is a clone of the Ampeg Dan Armstrong lucite guitar. Loaded with a Bare Knuckle “Riff Raff” hunbucker this guitar has a few improvements over the original vintage design; back-loader bridge for better sustain and perfect intonation a thicker neck joint attached with standard neck screws custom cut nitrate pickguard that will accept any standard-sized humbucker (those pickups in the original vintage run didn’t sound very good this one sounds amazing). The neck was also made from scratch and is shaped to a “Fender C” maple with a rosewood fretboard. Basically this guitar was built from scratch to outpace the originals. It is truly one of a kind and a great sounding and solid player.I will be raffling off this guitar on June 25th 2016 and 100% of the proceeds from ticket sales will be going directly to the Ferguson’s to help in offsetting medical bills or to be used as they see fit.There will be two ways to enter:The guitar will be on display at Eastside Music Supply until the drawing on June 25th tickets can be purchased directly from them starting today at $5.00/pc. No limit buy as many as you like.Also blocks of four tickets at $20/pc can be purchased through a site set up on GoFundMe called Take Back Life From Cancer. Just enter the text “Guitar Raffle” in the comments box when you make your donation and we will add four tickets in your name to the lot. You can hide the comment text if you like (the admin of the GoFundMe page can still see the text) but you have to enter the text “Guitar Raffle” in order to be entered. There are also no limits to the number of tickets that you can buy through this site but we do ask that you make donations in $20 increments and that you include a working email address so we can contact you if you win. Only donations made between 5/4/2016 and 6/25/2016 will be eligible for entry into the drawing.In the event that a winner is drawn who lives outside of Nashville TN I will cover shipping to your door with a hard case. However I will ask that a winning ticket from outside of the United States covers their own shipping.We are also working on adding additional runner-up prizes and will let you know when we add them.

I am incredibly grateful to all of you who have shared our page and donated to this family. It is not only the cost of this first treatment nor the mother's inability to work during its time but the unfortunate future these two lovely children will entail. While we are all desperate to hope for future medical advancements after their bone marrow transplant this current treatment does not prevent the troubling and grave neurocognitive decline expected during adolescence and continuing onward. It is difficult to believe that Jeanne and Camille who both look so beautiful and healthy today will suffer these consequences. Who just yesterday after school insisted on sharing their petits biscuits chocolats avec moi et mon fils. We can only hope to ease their suffering by lifting some of the financial burden from their medical costs (which far exceed our stated goal of $200000) and later financial hardship as they are unlikely to ever live or work independently. We can only hope they will be blessed enough to live through their 20s. It is difficult to write about such sadness. It is difficult to fathom such sadness. While I write this update with the reality that needs to be shared I realize that it fails to reflect the gravity of the situation as I must be able reread my own words and the pain in doing so is almost unbearable. Our financial and emotional support must reflect what these circumstances require but in our hearts we can have hope. In our prayers we can ask we can beg and we can wish for advanced medical care to surface with enough time to save these little children.

Between then and now a lot has happened with each ugly moment a beautiful one to follow (hence the quote). Most recently there are still no changes in the tumors found back in January unfortunately due to the original tumor Alaya has been diagnosed with stenosis (the narrowing of an artery). This narrowing of the artery in her brain has caused a lack of blood flow to the left side of her brain and she has been experiencing mini strokes (TIAs). Yesterday she underwent a procedure never performed at Dartmouth before an indirect bypass of the subtemporal artery. I will spare the details but this was done to allow blood flow back to that artery and to the left side of her brain. The surgery went well and she has been recovering in PICU. She has had some swelling in her face because of the blood essentially filling back in causing her some pain but she is such a trooper. Hopefully within the next couple days Alaya can return home and continue to recover in time for her 5th birthday next week!Nikki has continued to treat Alaya’s condition with holistic medicine which includes the CBD oil other essential oils and a specific Ketogenic diet. Next week will also be a year and a half since Alaya was initially diagnoses with ATRT despite this difficult journey we are so thankful for this strong baby girl still being here and pressing on and her just as strong Momma who has done nothing but give her all and very best. Alaya has defied all odds and will continue to fight on as her journey continues. I personally feel so blessed to have this amazing family.Please continue to share this post and prayers as much as possible. Nikki is still in dire need of donations to continue helping Alaya heal and fight medications are so expensive and her CBD oil is not covered by insurance any amount is appreciated. I will do my best to stay on top of updates.XOXO-Amandahttps://www.facebook.com/alayasfight/#AlayasFightafter surgerySnuggles and Snapchat+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Amanda Canales 11 months ago Share March 23 2017Hello Everyone! I apologize that there have not been any updates on the GoFundMe page in quite some time. To get everyone caught up Alaya has received multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation. In August we were teamed up with Boston Children’s to harvest her stem cells in case they are needed since Alaya has become neutropenic (low immune system) with almost every round of chemo. Between September and October Alaya was hospitalized again but this time for sepsis (severe infection) due to her already weakened immune system. She started to recuperate and was finally able to celebrate her fourth birthday Christmas and New Year’s! Through all this time we were given good news that Alaya’s MRIs had shown no change since the reduction of the original tumor. Nicolle has tried to continue Alaya’s regimen of CBD oils which have not only shown remarkable results in her cancer treatment course but has also given Alaya so much comfort while going through painful procedures like chemo. Unfortunately Alaya has been unable to receive the amount her body needs because of the cost; it takes about $500 a month to meet the BARE MINIMUM needs for her CBD oil (dosing is weight based). Although medical marijuana is legal in their home state of Vermont it still is incredibly expensive.2017 met us with even harder times than last year. Come late January our lives came crashing down again Alaya’s MRI revealed although the original tumor was stable there were at least three new lesions found in various areas of her brain. Adding to the heartbreak Nicolle is now struggling to raise her two girls (Alaya and Kianna) as a single parent. It is the worst pain imaginable to see people you love suffer and you’re just as helpless. The last few months have been more physically and emotionally draining than ever before which I didn’t think was possible.My family needs help now more than ever to get through this time. Any amount of donation prayer positivity is very much appreciated. Please continue to share our posts and links to spread the word!Thank you all so much!!!-Amanda#AlayasFightwww.facebook.com/AlayasFightbirthday cake!Chocolate is my favorite food group + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Amanda Canales 19 months ago Share July 21 2016HUGE UPDATE: We have some good news to report and some major information to divulge! After hearing Alaya\\'s initial diagnosis (we were told three days before the AT/RT diagnosis that some of the cells proved to be cancerous) we decided to tackle this head-on. We employed a quick and heavy info gathering task force! Many amazing friends and family stepped up to assist. The consensus was clear: Use CBD/THC in tandem with chemotherapy as recent studies have proven chemo to be far more effective when paired together with CBD and THC.CBD weakens cancer cell membranes allowing the chemo to be more effective; CBD/THC is a very effective anticarcinogen itself; and the combination has been shown to trigger the cancer cells to \"\"remember\"\" how to die via Apoptosis. We are happy to say we have seen AMAZING results thus far.After two rounds of chemotherapy in tandem with her \"\"home\"\" treatment Alaya\\'s tumor has shrunk remarkably ! The original tumor was somewhere around 6-8cm and was reduced by 60% upon her initial surgery/craniotomy (thanks to the amazing neurosurgeon Dr. Bauer and the staff at Dartmouth). The remaining 40% has been successfully reduced via treatment by ANOTHER 75%! We are now exploring our options to remove the little remaining cancer (@10% of the original size). It\\'s still a tricky situation as the remaining 10% lies directly on her artery feeding one hemisphere of her brain meaning that surgery may not be an option. Dr. Bauer is willing to remove more of the mass but has major concerns about removing anything abutting the artery.We will be heading to meet with the leading AT/RT specialist in Boston this week they want us to consider trying a new technique to attempt to \"\"more safely\"\" delivery radiation (Sterotactic Radiation Therapy).Radiation even when all precautions are taken has devastating long-term side effects.. So needless to say we are not sold on this procedure at all yet. However we are willing to hear them out before we re-assess and decide the next course of action. Which would be one of three; 1) Continue with chemo protocol: DFCI ATRT 02-0294; 2) Once continued protocol is done move to radiation therapy; or 3) Switch to high dose chemo. This is no small choice as continuing down the path of radiation or additional surgeries can come at enormous costs ie: permanent paralysis from surgery or life-lasting side effects from chemo and/or radiation.For fear of alienating or offending some folks we initially thought it best to keep mum about our treatment decision. In short Alaya was the youngest quickest member yet added to the VT Marijuana Registry (Thank you to the State of Vermont and aunt Alexis for making it happen ASAP!) and she was immediately placed on CBD then CBD/THC as a supplemental treatment before her chemo even started. We should also recognize the amazing group at the Enthusiast Smoke Shop in Rutland VT for supplying us with medicinal quality pure CBD and for staying open late numerous times for our frantic \"\"re-supply\"\" runs. And a HUGE THANK YOU to the Champlain Valley Dispensary for working out a custom-tailored CBD oil designed specifically for Alaya\\'s dosage needs. Our brother-in-law Erik St. Croix has been working hand-in-hand daily with the dispensary to fine-tune Alaya\\'s oils subsequently it will be sold and marketed hereafter as \"\"Alaya\\'s Oil\"\" for the countless other children that can be assisted by this amazing product!We are so touched by all this. EVERYONE has been incredible. We are SO grateful to have such an amazing group of friends and family you are all Alaya\\'s heroes and we owe you from the bottom of our hearts. From those who help hands-on love and support from family to the donations from those close to us... and even those who know nothing but Alaya\\'s story.So in closing today our battle continues but with newfound hope and options. We feel we would be wise to consider what the team in Boston has to say but we may also step back from chemo and radiation altogether and gauge the effectiveness of CBD/THC for the remaining 10%. We will decide what is best for this beautiful little girl and we will update you all as often as we can here.Our one major concern is the fact that no insurance providers will cover the CBD hence our frantic fundraising efforts (made possible by aunty Amanda). The money donated has helped us keep life normal while Nikki and Alaya spend huge amounts of time away from home helps us cover any extenuating medical and travel costs and MOST importantly... it allows us to continue to provide the highest quality CBD/THC for Alaya\\'s treatment. It is potentially one of the most important aspects of her treatment thus far and provides Alaya with actual quality time free from the pain nausea and the other side effects of her cancer and treatments.If you can continue to help us in Alaya\\'s fight or help spread the word! EVERYTHING helps and you are all AMAZING<3 !!!- Nick and Nikki4th of July fun!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Amanda Canales 20 months ago Share Friday June 24 2016This week marks the first month of Alaya’s cancer journey which has obviously been nothing short of a crazy rollercoaster ride. Alaya is slowly recovering from last week’s chemo. She is still barely eating or drinking requiring IV fluids and TPN. Her hair is falling out. Unfortunately the fall out as been so badly and what is left has become extremely matted that Nicolle had to shave her head.Since Alaya has been vomiting so much and not eating Nicolle was concerned and demanded an MRI to ensure there was no new growths especially since persistent vomiting is what lead to Alaya’s diagnosis. On Monday we got good news that there were signs of recession and no new growths in her brain or anywhere else!Wednesday Nicolle and Alaya were able to go home after a miserable week at CHaD. Alaya’s doctors are looking forward and have discussed the need for a G-tube which is a surgically placed tube into the stomach for medications and feeding. At the moment we are just trying to have Alaya enjoy time at home with her family before going back for her inpatient 80-hour chemo. Round two will start early next week but until then we are enjoying family time sunshine and Alaya’s smiles!The support and donations we have been receiving is overwhelming and very much appreciated! We need all of you to help keep Alaya’s story out there! Very soon we will be making an important announcement concerning Alaya’s care and cancer treatment which will bring an even greater need for support. Keep the positive vibes and prayers coming!!-Amanda + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Below is an update straight from the 33-year-old herself plus a video that might just make you laugh and cry all at once. We love you Aleah!!! Happy Birthday!!!--Last Thursday I had my LAST infusion treatment. My first treatment was way back in May of 2015 so you could say this has been a long time coming. Although the \"\"heavy\"\" chemo ended last September these targeted treatments have been my faithful every-three-week companion for what seems like forever. Am I elated to be done? YES! But there is a surprising part of me that\\'s also sad to be done. Now I don\\'t have the crutch of treatment to make me feel safe. It\\'s just me again facing the future with a hopeful heart. I am relieved I am grateful and I am a little fearful. But isn\\'t every big transition in life this way?I am feeling good overall my hair is growing back in and I\\'ve had enough time to find my own peace in this bummer of a situation. I\\'d say I\\'m doing pretty well!Today I also turn 33. The significance of 3 is not lost on me it\\'s the trinity the triad the triangle providing a solid and sturdy foundation. It\\'s past present and future. Each year I am more joyful to be having a birthday to be looking toward a future. 33 feels good.If you are reading this now I want to tell you how much it\\'s meant to me to have your support. In many ways I\\'ve felt like the luckiest girl in the world throughout this process...the support I\\'ve gotten has truly carried me through and has been a constant reminder of all the good in this world and in my life. Cancer sucks bad things happen but I\\'ll always believe in the good in this world.

It\\'s been physically and mentally taxing but I try to focus on the positives: the quality one-on-one time I get to spend with friends and loved ones who sit with me during chemo the fact that I have no weird lumps or bumps on my bald head and the gratitude I feel that I have had no major complications or reactions to treatment. My eyebrows and eyelashes are waving goodbye but the hair on my head is actually growing a little on this chemo regimen so that\\'s giving me hope! I\\'m reminded daily that I\\'m so much more than hair or boobs or the sum of my parts. Those things can come and go and I can still be ME for better or worse ;)I deeply feel everyone\\'s thoughts prayers support and every kind word that\\'s been sent my way. It has kept me going through some rough times and the gratitude I feel cannot be expressed by words.

The tumor that was in her brain is gone.When this all started Allie was given less than a 50% chance of living through the first surgery that removed the massive tumor from her brain. She made it.When she started the chemo and radiation the doctors predicted it would give her another 6 -12 months to live. That was almost 4 years ago now despite having an allergic reaction to the chemo that killed her blood and caused the Aplastic Anemia that we are trying to cure today.Over the past 4 years she has beat off multiple infections in spite of having no immune system and has endured a countless number of blood transfusions and hospital stays. We would do it forever if we could but the blood transfusions are no longer working like they used to and she has to get this bone marrow transplant in order to survive. It is scheduled for the end of April but we still don’t have the means to pay for it.Allie has overcome one hurdle after the next in her fight against cancer it will kill me if money is the one we can’t jump.

Allie is strong but your support donations cards and prayer make her stronger. We hope and plan to thank each and everyone of you personally. But for now THANK YOU THANK YOUTHANK YOU ALL very MUCH !!! Your cards prayers and donations are all greatly appreciated. Thanks again!!!I also want to thank my sister Margi for putting the GO FUND ME campaign together for us. With out her this campaign would have never happened. My sister in law Cammie for all her help and support at Allie's bed side. My cousin Chrissy for her perfectly timed words of wisdom and support but most of all my parents Craig & Ginny  without them I would be lost. Obviously there are so many more of you I want to thank directly but cant do it in one general email. Sorry I plan to start updating you all at least once a month maybe twice a month depending on her treatment schedule. Allie just finished her second round of chemotherapy. They plan to continue chemotherapy treatments every 28 days until it kills off the M.D.S. They believe it could take up to a half dozen treatments before she sees any results. The plan is to continue chemotherapy until the M.D.S is cured. Then she will be able to hopefully get a successful bone marrow transplant to re-jump start her auto immune system. As of now she is needing transfusions two and three times a week to replenish her platelets and white blood cells. When Allie isn't getting treatments or trying to eat and or sleep she loves to read the cards you have all sent. She wants you all to know that she hears your prayers and is very thankful for them. 'Once again Allie and I are truly thankful for all your help and support.

A few weeks ago I noticed small white bumps again on my tongue in the same area as my cancer site. I got it looked at immediately and a biopsy done as soon as possible. The first results came back negative. But after a CT and further pathology reports showed a precancerous mass in my tongue. Tomorrow I will have surgery to remove the affected portion of my tongue. More tests will be run on the tissue and we get some concrete answers. Hopefully this is the only treatment needed. Please pray for us tonight as we face this once again.+ Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Allison Hartzell 6 months ago Share A new residence....Today is day 6 of being in the hospital. No improvement has happened with my low blood pressure. Luckily all my heart and artery tests have come back normal. It's frustrating trying to find the source of the problem. Experienced a set back last night getting dizzy a headache and vomiting. I do not expect they will release me today. They will be doing an endoscopy today if I can handle the anesthesia. Blood counts are still low but on the rise. They started me on a blood pressure medicine that will hopefully raise it to a safe level. I had no clue how fragile I'd be after treatments. I was so excited when they said I was cancer free had no restrictions and could return to work. I miss my family dearly along with my students and colleagues. Ready to resume the life I've worked so hard to build.+ Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by Allison Hartzell 6 months ago Share One step forward three steps back....Today is the third day I've been in the hospital. I was admitted on Wednesday for a stomach virus. Of course any little virus is more dramatic with my low immune system. Because of the GI issues I was severely dehydrated and had constant fluids for the first 2 days. I was in isolation for fear I was highly contagious until results came back negative. They took me off the iv last night to see how I did this morning before sending me home. However this morning my blood work revealed that my counts actually got worse than when I arrived so I had to stay. I have been struggling with low blood pressure bottom numbers been in the 40's the whole time. The doctor ordered a plethora of tests to see what is causing my blood counts to drop and determine the cause of the low blood pressure. It now appears I'll be in the hospital until they can determine the cause. There is a great team of doctors checking all my systems to solve this puzzle. This is very unfortunate timing the first week of school but my first two days with the kids were awesome! I was able to see my kids and husband today which made my heart happy. My mom has graciously been with me almost the whole time as well. I am so lucky to have support from my in laws and colleagues too.

She had shorter days on Thursday and Friday...about 3 hours each day. This round has gone much better than the last...meaning no blood transfusion this time! Ally is managing to stay positive and becoming more comfortable with her appearance and having no hair. She is strong because she know that there are other kids out there in much worse condition and she tries not to complain because she knows she doesn't have it as bad as some. Ally is so compassionate caring and positive despite everything that has been thrown at her! She continues to inspire! Go Ally!Please share this with everyone! They could really use the help! Thank you!Ally after chemo!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Kerry Stewart 26 months ago Share Out with the old in with the new...isn't that what is said at the New Year?

She has taken this milestone in stride which is another reason why she is so inspiring! Happy New Year Everyone! Thank you for supporting Ally! Please continue to spread the word!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Kerry Stewart 26 months ago Share Today....is Ally's 18th BIRTHDAY! This certainly isn't the way she expected to celebrate this milestone but in true Ally form she is going to put some makeup on and get out of the house today!

       " '\"Update 19 Posted by Alyson Steffens 2 months ago Share I am feeling truly blessed as Christmas quickly approaches. The last couple of weeks have been filled with tests. The test results have been filled with great news! My tumor markers are down. Yay! My blood does not indicate any genetic mutations that affect blood clotting nor do I present with any clotting disorders. Yay! (This is great news since my hormone blocker that I will be on for the next 10 years increases chance of blood clots). An ultrasound on my leg where I\\'ve been experiencing pain and cramping was all clear! Yay! And x-rays of my back were sort-of good. I show moderate degenerative disc disease but I\\'ll take that over cancer any day! Thank you all for your continued support thoughts and prayers. Merry Christmas Happy Hanukkah and Happy Holidays to All!+ Read MoreUpdate 18 Posted by Alyson Steffens 3 months ago Share Happy Thanksgiving! This is the perfect opportunity for an update since I am so Thankful for all of you; my family friends acquaintances and even strangers who have supported me over the past 11 months. I am happy to say I have completed my cancer treatment! I was finished with chemotherapy on July 24th and had my last day of radiation on October 2nd. Regardless of \"\"chemo brain\"\" those two dates will forever be ingrained in my mind! Radiation was more of a challenge than I was expecting. I was scheduled for 30 sessions; 25 treatments to a large rectangular area that included the breast area  upper chest and lymph nodes. and a \"\"\"\"boost\"\" for 5 treatments which just radiates the area surrounding the mastectomy scar. Due to my red raw and blistering/peeling skin the oncologist stopped at 20 did the 5 boost treatments to give my chest a break then went back for the last 5 to the entire area. Needless to say The last day of radiation was quite a relief even though the pain lasted a few more weeks. An added benefit of the radiation is the effect it had on my sun damaged chest and neck. My skin is baby soft on that side! Now that treatment is behind me I am on a hormone blocker that I will take for the next 5 years. I will have to remain on my anticoagulant (blood thinner)for the duration since the blocker increases the risk of blood clots. The next step in the process is the reconstruction surgeries which will begin in the Spring 2018 and hopefully be completed before Winter! In the meantime I\\'m undergoing lymphedema therapy and getting regular check-ups with the oncologist. I\\'ve also met with a great nutritionist at Virginia Piper Cancer Center and have been implementing a nutrition program that is full of cancer fighting foods! I am also back at work and although I\\'m still fighting fatigue it is great to be back!Thank you all again for your support encouragement and love throughout this journey. Happy Thanksgiving!+ Read MoreUpdate 17 Posted by Cassy Meyers 7 months ago Share I am really excited to post this update tonight! I know its been awhile. Thank you for your patience.I am happy to report that Alyson graduated from her chemo treatments on 7/24/17! Yay!!!( I am hoping to attach a photo along with this so please look for it!)It\\'s been a long summer of treatments and doctor visits for Alyson. Mid summer during her treatments she began experiencing some chest pain and an irregular pulse. Her doctor administered medication for this. The the pain has since subsided but it has left her with a few other symptoms. She will be having an echocardiogram and stress test to help determine what these issues are on 8/17.Alyson will meet with her radiation oncologist on 8/7. Radiation treatments will begin approximately two weeks after that. Radiation will be 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Her doctor has given her a heads up that the fatigue she will experience may be more than what she experienced with the chemo treatments. With that being said I should mention that Alyson will be back to work full time starting next week. She will miss work to go to her appointments and to her treatments. I just pray she will be able to push thru and get the needed rest she will need when the fatigue sets in. Time will tell.More good news is that Alyson will have her port removed on 8/11.Per my last update back in May Alyson was experiencing some clotting. A recent ultrasound showed that the DVT jugular vein has dissolved. This is awesome!The following information is an estimated time frame for what Alyson will be doing to complete her treatments. After radiation is completed Alyson will start hormone blockers.Breast reconstruction/implant will be 3-6 months after completion of radiation.Surgery will be scheduled later on her right side for symmetry. If all goes as planned and I pray it does she will be done in summer of 2018.Alyson amazes me as her spirit and attitude continues to stay positive no matter the obstacle. Her heart is so full with gratitude from the outpour of love and support.I ask that you please continue to lift her up in prayer. This journey is still far from over but we are starting to see some light. Please keep the calls texts emails and donations coming in. It\\'s the little things that make each day a little brighter.I encourage you to share this post with your family and friends if you feel inclined to do so. Thank you for everything up to this point. Alyson is truly blessed!+ Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Cassy Meyers 10 months ago Share It\\'s been awhile since my last update but the timing couldn\\'t be better. In just 6 short days( May 17th) this beautiful woman Alyson that we all know and love dearly will be turning a whopping \"\"43\"\"!!! I couldn\\'t think of a better way to celebrate her than to share how amazing and strong she continues to be on this journey. The last few months have definitely had some unexpected challenges including another stay in the hospital. However her spirit and attitude continues to stay positive and joyful as she continues to push through each day and each challenge with such dignity and grace. She is an inspiration and defintiely a fighter!So it was about Easter weekend. We were all together at sunrise service on Easter Sunday. She looked fabulous and her spirit was good. During breakfast she told me she had been having some swelling and pain in her neck. She didn\\'t seem too concerned at the time but she let it be known something was going on and she was going to get it checked out. Just a few days later she informed me that she was diagnosed with a blood clot. (DVT in the jugular vein.) Treatment began that week with a new drug. They couldn\\'t use her port for chemo due to the clot. The day after her first treatment she ended up in the hospital. She turned beet red and her white blood cell counts were too high. They kept her overnight for observation and she was released the next day. She met with her oncologist and her treatment was changed. He felt she may have had an allergic reaction to the previous treatment. New treatment is now 9 sessions over 12 weeks instead of the 3 she had left over the 6 weeks. Last week when she went for her treatment her white blood cell count was too low pretty much non-existent.Today she just finished her new treatment 1 of 9 and she said she is \"\"doing fine!\"\"I was so happy to hear this today! I want nothing more than for her to be feeling good especially with her birthday right around the corner!Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this journey since the beginning. Your continued love support prayers donations calls texts and emails are appreciated more than you know!Her journey is far from over. Please continue to keep her in your constant thoughts and prayers. If you could please continue to share this update on your FB wall and any other social media sites you may be on  you are helping me to help Alyson by keeping the donations coming in for sweet our girl!Thank you all so very much! + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Unless you've been thru it you can't understand. The amount of pain you feel all day long is horrible. Watching your body change right nefore ypur eyes and not being able to do a thing about it. Watching your love one's watch you go thru these changes helpless and wanting to do so much for you but all they can truly do is pray.

Words can not begin to explain just how blessed I am. Just a few months ago I was diagnosed with one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer. At that point I could not imagine getting to this point. I was afraid like I have never feared anything in my life. I keep thinking over and over again Briana you know how this ends you know how it plays out in the end. You've been a how many bedsides watching this end watching helplessly. I felt helpless. I feared if my son would remember me or if my daughter would know me at all. I know they have a great dad but I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to watch them grow up and give them the mom they deserve. But my God is bigger than any disease or fear. My God said that he would never leave me nor forsake me. No one can ever tell me he is not real. The same doctor that told me how dangerous and aggressive this cancer is the same one who told me on Monday there is no trace of cancer in my body right now. Only God could do that. Those nights I sat up and cried to myself watching my son and husband sleep those countless days I made myself get up and move around so I wouldn't have to see juju cry or hear him say he wants me to feel better again. Those days and nights will continue to haunt my dreams. Playing on repeat my 2 year olds voice telling my mom it's not fair I want my mommy to feel better I want the doctor to fix her. Those days i cried until my eyes hurt. The millions of times I prayed for God to give me strength so my family and friends would believe me when I told them I felt fine but felt horrible. This are the things I will remember each time I see these scars oon my body. Most of all I will remember all the love and support I got from my family and friends! I love all of you.

Words can’t express how grateful we are and what an encouragement it is to know we are being prayed for.

Tanner will be starting school this week here in Mercer Island and Taylor and Timmy will be traveling back and forth each weekend.

Thank you so much! ??+ Read MoreUpdate 29 Posted by Paul Ernst 2 months ago Share Hi Everyone Sorry it’s been a while since we have sent out an update. It’s hard to share updates sometimes when the news is hard to tell & hear. Amy just completed her last round of chemotherapy in Seattle this week. The kids were able to join her and had a fun filled week planned by their extended family. That was definitely a nice distraction for all. Now for what is going on with Amy. The lungs seems to have reacted very well to the chemotherapy so that is very encouraging however the cancer has spread. She has been experiencing really bad migraine headaches and they found it was due to a tumor behind her right eye that makes it hard to see out of that eye. Treatment has been really rough on Amy the side effects are not pleasant. Amy will get an 8 week break before she needs to go back to Seattle for 9 weeks to receive radiation treatment. This is an extremely hard time for her and the kids and they’re all doing the best they can under these circumstances. If you’re able to help financially in any way that would be so much appreciated. You can either donate here directly or to her personally. We thank you for your continued support and prayers as they are needed now more than ever.

       " \"Update 3 Posted by Judith Schnitzler 11 months ago Share 11 In November Amy noticed a rash along her incision. A biopsy was performed and it was determined that she now had Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer. The cancer had spread to her lungs. After much anguish she began chemotherapy on November 29 2016. Her treatments were dose dense. Over the course of the next 8 weeks she received adriomyacin and cytoxin infusions. This particular combination resulted in extreme nausea hair loss and fatigue. This infusion was given with a heavy dose of steroids that negatively impacted her ability to sleep. She also received Nulasta shots the day after each infusion to help rebuild the blood cells that the chemo destroyed. The next 8 weeks she was given Taxol. Unfortunately Amy had a reaction to this. She was put on steroids for 6 days. She saw an allergist who prescribed a protocol to follow for the remaining infusions. Throughout this Amy tried to exercise daily. She was featured on NBC Nightly News. ( http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/exercise-best-cure-fatigue-caused-cancer-study-n728241). Most helpful to her were her weekly acupuncture appointments ($65 per appointment not covered by her insurance). Since completing her last chemotherapy treatment on March 9 Amy had CT and bone scans. The bone scans showed no evidence of cancer in her bones. The CT scan showed improvement (a shrink in the size of the measurable tumors) but still nodule involvement in the lungs. Amy is struggling with depression and treatment decisions. The therapist she had been seeing is experienced in working with people having metastatic cancer but does not take her insurance. At $90 per session we are no longer able to afford this and are looking for a new therapist. Her Integrative MD medical marijuana mistletoe injections (John Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore is conducting clinical trials) high dose Vitamin C infusions and supplements are not covered by insurance either. We are expecting to have further testing (Foundation 1- a genomic test that looks at the makeup of the tumor to shed light on what is driving the growth and what would be an effective treatment). This will most likely not be covered by insurance. Ridiculous right? We are continually looking at and investigating clinical trials that she qualifies for based on her diagnosis and stage. We are so appreciative of the generosity of others that has enabled Amy to benefit from uncovered treatments. Amy has $2665 left in her GoFundMe account which will be used to continue on this path as long as we can. We are grateful for your past and continued support.

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Vicky Azevedo 11 months ago Share It has a been a year since I got the devastating news that I had lymphoma. And 5 months since my world fell apart again when my initial treatment had failed. Now as I sit here hooked up to my IV receiving the antibiotics that are helping me fight this infection that landed me in the hospital on March 16th following a blood transfusion that resulted in a fever of 103. It was a difficult day that day. One that I wish my husband never have to witness as I laid there shaking in the hospital bed hooked up to multiple IV's as the nurses drew blood and did tests to figure out what was wrong with me. It's hard to see yourself that way but it's even more difficult to see the pain in your loved ones eyes because there's nothing they can do. As the day drew on and the antibiotics and IV fluids started to kick in I slowly began to feel better. That's when I got a call from the HR department at work letting me know that I no longer had a job due to my prolonged medical leave. As I explained to them that I had all the paperwork to prove that I was still going through treatment they simply said that I had exceeded the allotted time for LOA and that my position was being resigned. As most of us do I have my insurance through my job which according to them I no longer had. I asked them what was going to happen with my insurance and with no sympathy they said you have until the end of the month. And that was it. So now I'm not only feeling like crap fighting this infection but now this wave of distress comes over me as I try to think how in the world I'm going to afford what's coming next. Once I felt better the following day I was able to research insurance plans that would cover my bone marrow transplant. Unfortunately the ones that do are more expensive my than premiums before. I was discharged from the hospital on Sunday March 19th. Unfortunately I have to make daily trips back to Sacramento so that I can get my IV antibiotics. I was scheduled for stem cell collection on Monday March 20th and I finished collection Tuesday March 21st. I am due to be admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant unit at Sutter Sacramento on Tuesday March 28th. There I will commence the last step in my treatment process. Beginning with a week of high dose chemotherapy followed by my bone marrow transplant and recovery time. I am hopeful for a good outcome and that I will once and forever be cured of cancer. But as my Doctor has discussed with me due to the results of my latest petscan which showed only decrease in size in some of the tumors while others remained the same and one enlarged. There is a possibility that this transplant will not cure my cancer due to the bulky nature of my tumors. Because of this I have been told that if the transplant does not go as planned the only remaining treatment plan would be maintenance chemotherapy. This is a life long treatment which consist of a dose of chemotherapy every 3 weeks for the remainder of my life to keep the tumors under control and stop them from growing. It has been a grueling battle. Although at times the mental physical and financial stress have made me feel like giving up I am thankful for my family and friends that have helped to push me forward and keep fighting. Your continued support has and continues to help me and my family financially and emotionally. Thank you all for your encouraging words and prayers - Anabel Medina Quindiagan+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Vicky Azevedo 13 months ago Share Today Anabel will be admitted back to Sutter Medical Hospital in Sacramento for another 36 hr round of chemotherapy.

And I asked myself how you look up for grace in the mist of darkness . After I valiantly fought against the ugly disease that already took my breast but not my spirit! I don’t know what to do with this information. It’s too close. Too painful. And so I fluctuate between tears and numb. I'm between not understanding and asking for help with my lack of understanding. I have 5 more radiations to do and the medical bills are another thing that I have to fight with. I don’t not have all of the answers and cures. God is still in charge of my moments my live. But for now I reach out to you for help prayers donations and more prayers.

God bless you all!Ana+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Ana Maria Codrean 32 months ago Share 11 Greetings! I have not been keeping up. It has been quite an emotional ride and I am really trying hard to keep things up and positive. The almost daily visit to Dr. Ferguson for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy it’s exhausting regardless of the discomfort or the fact that I am still waiting to find out if I'll need further treatment. The oxygen therapy is helping me to heal my open wound. My last visit with my oncologist gave me news that I was afraid of in regards to the type of cancer that I have. She told me that the cancer is not curable and that I need to continue treatment with two drugs administered through IV (Perjeta and Herceptin) for the rest of my life. With me not working and needing to go back to school it is so difficult to keep up with all the expenses for treatments and payment plans. Humble I ask you to help me reach my financial goal. For those of you that have been able to donate I'll never be able to show you my gratitude for your generosity and kindness. To those of you that have sent me prayers hugs best wishes your emotional support is equally as meaningful. You ALL help me and keep me going! I CANT do it without you. Thank you again.

       " '\"Update 7 Posted by Mandy Schexnailder 5 months ago Share Chanda Alleman--Monday October 2nd 2017:At 2:03 my baby went to heaven. She is now dancing with our Lord.Anais is my HEART ----She was STRONG. She was a FIGHTER.+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Mandy Schexnailder 13 months ago Share 22 Per Chanda Alleman:Day 196 post initial transplant. Yesterday - what a surprise! Everyone including our sweet lady from housekeeping knew we were getting discharged. I corrected each person as they came in our room - the discharge planner the person from Carepoint even the volunteer lady - that they were mistaken. Stephanie our Hemonc NP just told us the previous evening that at the earliest Anais would be discharged early next week. Well Stephanie rounded at 1pm and confirmed that she changed her mind. Anais\\' ANC jumped from 30 to 90 overnight. Although this is still critical I think she decided for Anais\\' own sanity to discharge her. This was the first time since Anais has been diagnosed that she has had enough of being in the hospital -- and I have to attribute that to 9th floor not feeling like our home. The last 25 days of this admit felt like a lifetime. Stephanie also knows that if anything changes with her status that I would not hesitate to bring her back in. The latest update is that Anais indeed has a new donor. Don\\'t know any specifics yet other than that it is a 9 out of 10 match. Don\\'t know sex age or what HLA marker is not a match. We will follow up with the Hemonc clinic on Tuesday & Thursday of next week. If Anais\\' ANC is high enough she will undergo a bone marrow biopsy on Thursday. If Anais is in remission then the tentative date for transplant is February 28th. Since there will be a lag in time from last chemo to transplant she will need chemo to bridge her before starting the conditioning chemo for transplant. If she is not in remission then she will start her second month of induction chemo. Praying that Anais is indeed in remission and that she will not have any complications --- so we will be able to have a good break between hospitalizations. Anais is starting with another rash since her ANC is coming up. Praying that it will not progress into the full body rashes that have plagued her since days after the initial transplant. Prayers also continue for no permanent injury to her organs & organ systems. And ultimately our prayers are for a total and complete cure!!!As alwaysAnais is Strong. She is a Fighter. She is my Heart.+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Mandy Schexnailder 15 months ago Share Update from Chanda...Day 125 post transplant. We spent all day in clinic yesterday .... So exhausted. The visit ended with having to have Anais\\' new PICC line pulled due to a blood clot in her arm. They will not put one back in for a little while. In that regard she is happy to be free from lines during this time. Downside is that she will have to have a peripheral access placed each time we go to clinic. She will undoubtedly receive blood products during Monday\\'s clinic visit but she hasn\\'t had to receive as much over the last 2 weeks. Yeah!!!Bone marrow biopsy and chimerism results post chemo & DLI show that she still has \"\"abnormal cells\"\" and that donor cells have increased from 80% to 91%. The increase % of donor cells is an improvement but not good enough .... the goal is 100% donor cells. She will have to undergo another 10 days of chemo followed by a higher dose DLI. Don\\'t know when they will start this since she again has a new rash that started on Tuesday and Dr. Krance thinks it is definitely GVHD. He will re-evaluate on Monday.Anais is asking to go home for a few days for Thanksgiving. Dr. Krance is not yet giving us the ok with everything going on. Although her ANC is too low for outings or extended family gatherings it would be great to be home for a few days to regroup.It is quiet costly trying to run 2 households financially on my husbands salary only and supplementing with the funds received from the benefit. I will never be able to thank enough everyone who was involved with making Anais\\' benefit such a success and all those who gave support but were unable to attend. + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Mandy Schexnailder 25 months ago Share Anais was discharged Friday evening. A little nervous about going home since our time home was cut short the prior 2 times she was discharged.She will be admitted again on Wednesday for a lumbar puncture and to begin her second round of chemotherapy. We received the news on Wednesday that she was not in remission. Due to this the more aggressive road map for chemotherapy will be utilized and a bone marrow transplant will be necessary.We did receive news on Friday that the \"\"smart\"\" pill has been approved and it will be utilized on the days when she is not receiving chemo.The outpouring of support in helping to get the word out about BeTheMatch and getting more Asians screened has been overwhelming. We are so appreciative and feel that she will get her match.Anais is strong. She is a fighter. She is my heart. No other option ... Anais will beat this.Please go to join.bethematch.org/theateam if interested in being tissue typed as a potential donor for Anais.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 8 Posted by Jenn Spano 7 months ago Share Hello friends and family! We have so many great things to update you on!! Yesterday Andy had two appointments the first since surgery. Her breast surgeon informed her that the 3 lymph nodes (removed during surgery) were all negative all breast tissue was removed with no invasive cancer found. Her cancer was contained and had not spread to any other areas. She is now officially % CANCER FREE and no radiation treatments are needed!! Then her plastic surgeon ended up removing the drains they placed for swelling (she complained about their discomfort regularly) and cleared her to finally be able to shower (this meant so much her!). Starting next week the plastic surgeon will begin breast reconstruction which will mean weekly visits to his office through September. Once reconstruction is complete her next surgery will be scheduled in late September early October. Needless to say yesterday was full of wonderful blessings. Prayers have been answered and once again we want to thank you all for continuing to pray support and send love as she recovers. It means everything to her and our family! #AndysArmy+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Jenn Spano 7 months ago Share Hello friends and family! Just a quick update Andy recovers a bit more everyday. The drainage from her tubes is lighter in color and lessons each time they are checked both are very good signs. Right now it's all about healing pain management and staying on schedule with antibiotics. Next update will be Wednesday when she finds out the results to her pathology report and she's looking forward to possibly having the drains removed. Keep the prayers coming and the good vibes flowing that cancer hasn't spread to her lymph nodes!! Thank you all for the continued love and support we so desperately need at this time. We appreciate all you've done and continue to do!! #AndysArmy+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Jenn Spano 7 months ago Share Hi friends and family!! We are happy to update everyone with great news. Andy is doing great so far! She does have a great deal of pain as to be expected but she is staying strong and managing well. She is eating well and still learning how to maneuver without the use of arms and chest which has been the hardest adjustment for her. The simplest things are the biggest challenges. Please keep praying for her. Her road to recovery has just begun. Thank you all for all the love support and generosity! Every little bit helps! # AndysArmy+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Jenn Spano 7 months ago Share The breast removal portion of the surgery is over and went very well.

His amazing medical team was able to remove the full tumor. We are truly blessed! Andrew is now home recovering at Emily's in Chicago and doing great (minus temporary blurred vision and neck pain due to the operation).He will go through some more testing including a spinal tap to ensure the cancer did not spread to the spine or elsewhere. He most likely will go through a round a radiation to wipe out any potential cells left.All in all Andrew is doing well - this has been a fast and furious 2 months.

       " \"Update 9 Posted by Nicole Maletto 18 months ago Share Hello everyoneJust letting all of Angelika's Angels gofundme supports (and all others) know that she has been doing awesome lately. Exciting news came to us on Tuesday August 23rd. Angelika has officially entered into the maintenance phase of her treatment. This is a huge step to beating cancer. And best of all her life will seem more normal now. She was able to make it for the first day of school today which she is VERY excited (and nervous) about!!! This last weekend we were at Boomfest (large co-benefit for Angelika and Chloe) hosted by Todd Parisi and put together by LOTs of people. Thank you to everyone who helped put that together and make it as awesome as it was. We all had a great time!And as most of us have seen towards the end of July Angelika and the family was able to spend a whole week in Walt Disney World in Florida which was nothing short of the most magical and awesome time ever!! Thank you to Make-A-Wish for the whole trip and making it so special.Thanks everyone for your continued support and prayers we have come a long way and were cruising towards cured now. I will continue to periodically post updates when exciting things happen. Thanks again every one of you. You truly are Angelika's Angels.+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Nicole Maletto 20 months ago Share *Angelika Update* The doctors believe she may have VOD (Veno-occlusive disease) of the liver which is blockage of the very small (microscopic) veins in the liver. It causes issues like bleeding in her stool so there will be more testing. Issue was caused by all of the chemo and medication. It is treatable with a plasma transfusion but she is IGA deficient and has allergic reactions to plasma. So they are going to try a few different things. The important levels in her blood are still very low so she will continue to get blood and platelets as needed. On a positive note the Infection seems to be gone from her blood. Her blood pressure has come to normal and her fevers have appeared to stop. Her fluid levels in her lungs and swelling have come back down to a normal level. The goal for release is set for July 5th.+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Nicole Maletto 20 months ago Share 11 *UPDATE* Its been one week today since Angelika was airlifted to UPMC Pediatric Intensive Care Unit under bad conditions. As of today she is still in a regular room however some progress has been lost. Today she is on many new medicines because she came down with pneumonia. The doctors say they are not finding much of any infection in her port anymore but her blood still has a lot of infection in it. She still continues to run fevers and her heart rate is still high. They have run many tests including x-rays and CT scans and still no results.. they are unsure at this time where the infection is in her body. They are putting her back into isolation through the weekend and she will remain there until it's found. I will be going back down Friday to spend the weekend with them and I will post future updates. Please keep her and our family in your thoughts and prays. We are really hoping for a quick recovery and to get her home so she can enjoy some of her summer. Thanks again to everyone who has donated and helped us through these times. Thanks for being one of Angelikas Angels.+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Nicole Maletto 21 months ago Share As most of you already know Angelika has had one of her worst days today. For the first time since diagnosis she was airlifted to UPMC Intensive Care Unit for emergency treatment. She had just received blood and platelet transfusions as well as chemotherapy yesterday at UPMC and then made the long trip home. So it was very unexpected when her temperature spiked to 103.5 today and she was rushed to the hospital. Blood tests show her platelets and white blood cells in her blood dropped to 0% and she has an infection in her blood stream. As most of you may know without something to fight off the infection it has spread rapidly through her. The doctors are quickly doing what they can to replace the blood and platelets in her as well as rid her of the infection. The good news in she's in great hands and her outlook is positive. She is truly the toughest most amazing child I know. Even on days like today her spirits were still high and she's still positive. We will have a long unknown number of days down here but she can fight through this too. Thanks to each and every one of you for your help. It has not gone under appreciated. These trips and treatments are very costly and your help has eased the financial burden so we can focus on what is important and that's our Angel Angelika. Thanks again for supporting our campaign and becoming on if Angelikas Angels.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 29 Posted by Amy Metzger 36 months ago Share Day???? It is an EXCELLENT DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ben had his Day 100 Bone Marrow Biopsy done on Monday and got a call from the Dr today with the results. And we are just so thrilled! Absolutely NO and I mean NO signs of Leukemia cells in his marrow. OH MY GOD!!! I just can't believe this news..it is just so profound exciting a wish come true the best day for Ben and our family!!And I really don't believe that this would have happened had it not been for all of those prayer warriors that lifted Ben up in prayer. Asking the Lord to heal him to have the donor's cells work and asking for the Lord to guide the Drs. And the Lord healed him. We just can't thank you all enough. We can't thank the donor who has saved Ben's life enough. So please hear my thanks to you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your support your positive thoughts and energy and your prayers. We have just the best news!!! Love to you allAmy+ Read MoreUpdate 28 Posted by Amy Metzger 37 months ago Share OMG....didn't realize that it was that long ago that I had posted an update. I am sorry for that! The old saying is right though....no news is good news!!! So today is DAY 94 and DAY 100 is quickly approaching. And so far Ben is doing really well. His Drs are very pleased with how things are going to this point. They have been watching his liver levels due to them being high at one point; but feel that those levels were affected by some medication Ben had been taking. Ben is no longer on those particular meds and therefore the levels are slowly dropping. Ben is still on steroids but those as well are being slowly weaned from him. Ben will go back to the Drs this Thursday for regular bloodwork and hopefully will find out when the bone marrow biopsy will be performed. Once that test is done we will know if Ben is completely engrafted and the Drs will check to see if Ben has any leftover Leukemia cells.On a lighter note Ben is getting his hair back and it is much much darker than what it was before. Wonder what color hair the donor has???We ask for continued prayer for Ben; for his strength to continue to recover and that they find no sign of Leukemia in his marrow. We also ask that you pray that the engraftment process has taken hold. The power of prayer is a mighty thing. We thank you for all of your support these last 9 months. All of the prayers the positive thoughts and your support of Ben's costs. When a family is touched by all of this you are renewed that the world still has tons of wonderful heartfilled people. Also please continue to say a prayer of thanks for the donor. What a wonderful unselfish thing he did!!!!!Love to you allAmy+ Read MoreUpdate 27 Posted by Amy Metzger 38 months ago Share DAY 58!!!!! Over half way now to Day 100!!!! Ben's graft vs host rash is now almost gone. The high dose of steroids have helped get that rash under control. Yet with taking such a high dose everyday Ben has been having pain in his knees and ankles. He does have some pain medication to help with the joint issue. Ben had an appointment on Wed and things are going well. His anti-rejection levels are now good; they had been inconsistent for quite awhile. So this is very good news!!! And I believe that everything else in his blood looked good. Ben did inform me that the bone marrow biopsy will not be done until around Day 100. Ben and his Dr discussed this and decided to wait. Ben will see his Dr this coming Monday so we are anxious to hear what his Dr has to say.We still ask for prayers for Ben; to continue to get stronger each day; for the engraftment process to continue; and that this graft vs host rash is a sign that the donor's cells are fighting.....no killing off any Leukemia cells that might be left. We also ask that you lift Ben in prayer for the stress that this whole process has brought. The monthly medication cost for Ben are astronomical. We thank God for some of the drug companies that have helped Ben with costs. Thank you for all of the support the positive thoughts and the prayers. Ben and our family are just so overwhelmed by the response the support. We just can't say thank you enough. Love to you all Amy+ Read MoreUpdate 26 Posted by Amy Metzger 39 months ago Share DAY 48!!! Ben and Kenzie are home for Christmas!! Ben is doing pretty good. Some things have happened since the last post but nothing too serious. Last Monday Dec 15 Ben spiked a fever late in the afternoon. Called his dr and they told him to go to the local er and have things checked out. He did and the er figured that there was no infection this was a graft vs host issue. That hospital didn't want to intervene so told Ben that he would have to go to Hershey. Finally at 4:30am Ben was admitted. And it turns out there was a big misunderstanding. Long story short...the er when calling Hershey told Hershey Ben had a temp of 106 when his temp was 100.6. Ben was discharged on Wed afternoon. It was a graft vs host issue. Ben also just had another appointment yesterday and the graft vs host rash has gotten worse. So his steroids have been jumped back up to where they were when he was discharged post transplant. He has millions of red spots all over especially on his torso. And not too itchy!! The bone marrow biopsy had to be rescheduled due to the drs thinking that Ben had a very high fever. Not sure when that will take place.We are just so thankful and grateful that Ben is able to be at home for Christmas. Ben has been given such a gift....it is just so mindblowing overwhelming wonderful humbling and awesome. The gift of life from a stranger!!! Thank you God for bringing this stranger to the registry just when Ben needed him the most. And I can never thank the young man enough.And we thank you all......May you all be Blessed this Christmas with joy peace and health. Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!

       " 'Update 1 Posted by Chris Tang 30 months ago Share Thank you to all for your support and compassion. I’m excited to say that we have reached our initial fundraising goal; we could not have done so without the kindness of each and every one of you. Here is a recent update from Arthur who has gone through quite a bit since his transplant in February:To everyone who has kept me in their prayers and good wishes—thank you. This past year has been extremely difficult for me and my family; we have persevered only by the grace of God and the utter generosity from others. I am truly humbled by all of you from longtime friends to-- well people I have never met before—friends to be. Thank you for being a blessing in my life.Shortly after my bone marrow transplant in February my cancer relapsed in June. I was recovering well but another biopsy had shown that it was aggressive as ever: 95% of my bone marrow was leukemia. Immediately I was admitted back to the hospital to undergo another round of intensive chemotherapy.Knowing about the relapse… put my heart was in a vice. Any semblance of normalcy was gone. For the next three weeks I laid in bed in the hospital numb from the pain—pain from the chemo pain from the news. Though destroying much of the cancer the additional chemotherapy failed to achieve remission: the leukemia remained.It was at this point in time the best option was to undergo a new immunotherapy still in clinical trial: CAR T-Cell therapy at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. The treatment is relatively new; it is less than five years old and has treated only about a hundred patients. My family was nervous but hopeful. They extracted my lymphocytes in order to modify and culture them to target the leukemia cells. During this time I underwent additional chemotherapy. Five days after the infusion of the modified cells the treatment began to activate and I was rushed back to the hospital with high-grade fevers and chills. Meanwhile I also contracted a cold and had to undergo surgery to remove an abscess from my body. Not counting the transplant this was the most physically arduous time; I was in constant pain and my blood counts refused to recover.Today I am grateful to say that I have been discharged from the hospital. Also another biopsy has confirmed that I am now in remission! I still have a long ways for recovery and each day is still a struggle. Looking ahead I have to face the decision of whether to receive a second bone marrow transplant or not. The funds raised are being used to pay hospital bills as well as food and housing here in Seattle. Thank you for your encouragement in such a difficult time. There remains much uncertainty in the future but I will rely on the only things I have: hope faith and your support. Sure enough It has gotten me this far.Gratefully yoursArthur+ Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 621 total shares',\n",

Mercer 40 months ago Share Holy cow- this is the first time since posting this page for my dad that I have gone through and looked at each individual donation. Making a master list of all the incredible people that we need to thank!! It took 774 amazing people and donations to raise an overwhelming $91890 dollars. UN. REAL. Dad now has a trust set up strictly to help with the paying of bills that might last a lifetime. As many of you who have gone through this experience know this is a new way of life for dad. While he has completed his first round of chemo we have to be prepared for the possibility of future rounds and additional care or treatment down the road. Being able to sleep at night knowing he will get the best care possible has been a dream come true thanks to you all! Looking forward to the arrival of our chemo bill and being able to say see you later!This past Thursday dad went in for his post chemo scans and bone marrow biopsy. He will meet with his oncologist on the 20th and we are hoping to finally have some good news to share with you all by his birthday on November 25th. I cannot thank you all enough for the support. Its truly overwhelming. Just scrolling through all your comments and donations puts a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. I love you guys! + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 21 Posted by Lindsay Espy 4 months ago Share Update 10/24/17: (written by Dan) So this is where we are. No trial for me anywhere in the near future bc of my kidneys.We had 2 main choices to make: Choice one:We do nothing relax and spend the next two to three months \"\"making myself comfortable\"\" and being with the family. That\\'s right I said 2 to 3 months and none of us thought anything would happen that quick. This fucking sucks.Choice two:We do chemo called R-EPOCH. It like a lot like my original chemo RCHOP but this is delivered over 5 days in the hospital at Penn since it is much stronger and we have added the E. We also hope to add Venetoclax but This Has to go through insurance...This choice Has 3 paths emerging from it they are as follows in grim to best order.. Post Chemo Path 1:My bodies bone marrow can not handle the chemo and I can\\'t bounce back. Essentially my bone marrow is fried and I die in the hospital. Unsure of the timing on this and my doc thinks and so do we that we won\\'t need this path. Post Chemo Path 2:My bodies bone marrow can handle the chemo however we show no tumor drop. In this case we interupted my quality of life to try and save me and I am back in the Choice 1 \"\"make me comfortable\"\" path. Post Chemo Path 3:My body can handle it my tumors shrink and we do 1 more chemo cycle in 3 weeks. Voila! After we complete chemo round 2 I could potentially now quallify for clinical trials again when my kidneys are doing better or a few other options. Its a long path but we will take it. Choice 2!!! The fight must go on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thursday was my birthday. Friday was the start to chemo (5-8 days). I\\'m tolerating meds pretty well but I\\'m tired and my heart rate goes low at night. EKG and echo are fine so they\\'re monitoring this.+ Read MoreUpdate 20 Posted by Lindsay Espy 4 months ago Share Update 10/10/17: well a lot of things have happened since the last update. Unfortunately we did not start the trial on our initial start date. After unexpectedly taking the entire family up to New York and having a bone marrow biopsy and extra blood work done Dan\\'s blood work on his kidneys came back high so we had to postpone. We were/are disappointed scared and really upset. I was determined to make the most of our time there so we took an extra few days just for the family to explore the city. And eat some good food. Dan has another brain MRI full body pet Ct scan and EKG tomorrow. He has blood work on Saturday. All of these have to have the results that we need them to have for us to start his trial on Tuesday. Prayers/hopes/wishes that everything works out!!! Thanks!Enjoying time at pumpkin patch and on hay ride!+ Read MoreUpdate 19 Posted by Lindsay Espy 5 months ago Share Update 9/15/17: Bloodwork on Tuesday show that his creatinine was 1.4 which is a great number! It\\'s what we needed to get him into the trial we are adjusting some of his meds/vitamins that might have been hurting his kidneys and he is getting bloodwork twice a week to monitor his levels.We also have found an apartment/hotel! It\\'s at Memorial Sloan Kettering’s 75th Street Patient Residence - 411 East 75th Street. Yesss!! We got the results back of Dan\\'s full body pet and CT scans. The cancer has not gotten into any other areas which is good but it is still growing in previously known areas. Dermatology got back to us today and the spots on his body are not lymphoma fungal or bacterial. They think that it might\\'ve been a reaction to a combination of drugs but the spots are definitely improving. We have a crib mattress for Tyler as well as a crib for him to use when we are there. Thank you everyone for offering to help with this!We are still working on finding a place for the car to be parked whenever Tyler and I are there. And I plan on coming back in for one or two times before the end of the trial after I coordinate with work.For those of you who do not have Facebook and therefore do not see many pictures of our family Dan is still able to walk around and play with Tyler on a limited basis. The majority of his pain comes from his back left flank which limits his typical bubbly self. When we go out and do typical normal fun things for our family our spirits are really lifted. We are looking forward to tailgating with our friends tomorrow for a few hours.Thanks all for your continued support+ Read MoreUpdate 18 Posted by Lindsay Espy 5 months ago Share Update 9/12/17: we are absolutely blown away by the generosity that continues to be given to our family!!! It brings tears to my eyes. We appreciate it so much and thank you so much!!Dan and his dad are in Philadelphia today to see a kidney specialist since his kidney numbers/ function have not been the best and we want to make sure we are doing everything we can for them. He is also going to get his full body pet scan and CT scan while he is at Penn. These are requirements of the trial. He is going to see his oncologist there quickly too and might see a dermatologist because he has had some red dots show up on parts of his body. We aren\\'t sure if it\\'s from lymphoma or possibly something else so they might take some samples to test them in the lab. This will be determined after he sees his oncologist. Dan is done taking his steroids at this point because we are nearing our start date for the trial. We are waiting to hear back from one place in New York regarding an apartment for us to stay in. We hope this works out because it\\'s actually somewhat affordable and they work with cancer patients on a regular basis. Fingers crossed!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Lara Schecter 5 months ago Share Harlow has completed her 6 rounds of chemotherapy to treat her ovarian cancer! We just have one huge step to complete until she's done with treatment. At the end of September Harlow will be admitted for a 30 day stay in the hospital. This will include 3 days of high dose chemo.. followed by her stem cell transplant. They will be giving her back the stem cells they took from her a few months back. Her levels will be rock bottom for over a week so that is why we need to be inpatient for so long. Keep Harlow and us in your prayers! This will be challenging with a newborn and living in the hospital for so long.. but we will make it work!

This is Harlows mom Bianca.After chemo round two Harlow was more nauseous than the first time around so our first week was rough. She is also on medicine and antibiotics when we are home so any given day can range from 3-8 syringes that are always a fight to get her to take. Thankfully this time we have stayed out of the hospital without any fevers!! Praise God!Yesterday we had to be in the infusion center for 4 hours while Harlow received blood due to her hemoglobin being a little low. She was one tough cookie having to get her port accessed twice yesterday! She is now back in good spirits and running around and being the toddler we love to watch!On Friday we will be going in for chemo round 3 hopefully making us half way through the treatment once completed! We pray that her tumor markers stay low and the treatment does what it's supposed to be doing.We are sad to be in the hospital over Father's Day but at least we will be together as a family of 3 (4 including the baby bump)!

       " '\"Update 8 Posted by Mike Thompson 19 months ago Share Mike gave us access to the GoFundMe page so we could update everyone on our progress. Barrett and I have come a long way since October 2015. When Barrett was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer Mike was quick to come alongside and offer his assistance and for that we are grateful! Your donations helped us with medical bills incurred specifically for sperm banking and fertility testing. Barrett\\'s diagnoses came in October and treatment started at the beginning of November which meant we had a short amount of time to do what we could to preserve our chances to start a family. The sperm banking process was more involved than initially planned due to complications most likely caused by Barrett\\'s prostate cancer; but after a long surgery process the procedure was a success. Barrett\\'s sperm banking procedure was on a Tuesday and the very next day he started chemotherapy treatments. Soon after I was able to begin the IVF process which started with a handful of tests to let the doctors know what they would be working with. Unfortunately early on in the process we learned that IVF was no longer an option for us. Further testing showed that my body is not able to produce enough eggs during each cycle for the IVF process. Even if we were to move forward and try IVF based on test results there was less than 1% chance of success.The IVF doctor was very kind and sincere as she reviewed our test results and gave us different options to pursue. After much prayer we felt that we were being called to adopt. There are so many children who need a good home and loving parents to call mom and dad. It would be a blessing to be given the opportunity to adopt and start our family. Barrett has completed chemotherapy hormone reduction therapy and prostate surgery. His last visit to the oncologist was a positive visit. His blood work came back showing no more cancer cells (yay). His physical therapist said Barrett\\'s body has healed from prostate surgery and gave him the green light to start working out and-- wait for it -- get back on his bike (YAY and YAY)! Praise!Now that we are healthy and rested we are ready for the next step--start the adoption process. We are moving forward with Gladney an adoption agency based in Fort Worth. We will keep our GoFundMe page open as there will be costs associated with the adoption process and we are still paying medical bills associated with cancer treatments and surgeries. The love and support we have received from family friends friends of friends and friends of family has been encouraging and most of all not taken for granted. Thank you for your support--both financially and through your prayers and well wishes. We look forward to continuing to share our story as we continue down this wonderful journey to start a family!!Colorado Rockies game+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Mike Thompson 27 months ago Share Got to see Barrett at Mike\\'s Moonlight Run last night.

       " '\"Update 9 Posted by Kathryn DaSilva 8 months ago Share 22 We are happy to share with you that as of June 16th Shane is officially in remission! We returned to CHOP 5 days later to have his port and his broviac lines removed. It has been a very long 17 month process but to see him run around play in the water and interact with other kids is an awfully nice reward. In some ways it was a bitter sweet day being that my father Jim O\\'Donnell who was a tremendous help and who created an airtight bond with Shane suffered a subarachnoid brain hemmorage in early April. He remained in a coma for a month before he passed away on May 4th and was not there to celebrate. My dad often spoke of what that day would be like and although we know he was there with us in spirit it sure would have been nice to see those two embrace! We remain eternally grateful for all of the support we received from friends families and even total strangers. We learned that there are a lot of good people in the world anxious to make a difference in the lives of others. The O\\'Donnell\\'s+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Kathryn DaSilva 12 months ago Share Much has happened since our last update... We have blown past the one year marker of Shane\\'s diagnosis we celebrated Shane\\'s 2nd birthday and enjoyed Alexa\\'s 1st birthday which collectively reminds us of how far we\\'ve come. Just after Christmas Shane began immunotherapy treatments to help retrain his immune system to fight off bad cells. It consists of two main drugs that are given through his central lines at the hospital and several other drugs once he returns home. Shane will have to complete 6 rounds in total 2 of which we did already. From this point forward he should be repeating the same steps as those which we have just done so we have an idea of what we can expect. As always Shane remains upbeat and happy as can be. He still thinks he owns the hospital everytime he gets admitted. He runs around the halls singing flirting with the nurses and saying \"\"hi\"\" to everyone we pass even if it is the same 5 people 30 times. We are grateful for all the hardworking nurses and doctors that see he gets the best from them each and every day. As we move closer to the end of the treatment plan we can continue to use your daily prayers as relapse is the scary reality in half the children with this disease. Thank you to everyone that continues to motivate cheer on and pray for Shane as he continues plugging along!Mike and Tina+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Kathryn DaSilva 16 months ago Share November 12 2016-from Mike and Tina We are approaching the 10 month marker from Shane\\'s initial diagnosis and we are starting to see the light at the end of the treatment tunnel. As of our last update Shane had his 2nd auto stem cell transplant and spent 3 weeks in the hospital recovering. He was very anxious to get home to begin doing the things kids should be doing once again. He\\'s made the most of his restrictions while he has been home because he likes to play outside and the weather has been pretty cooperative. He has made weekly trips to CHOP for follow up appointments and then on October 24th he began radiation on the area in his abdomen where the primary tumor was located. He was put under anesthesia for 12 straight day until he got to ring the bell on November 8th. It was an exciting moment but there is still more to do. Shane will get another round of scans next month and then begin the first of 6 months of immunotherapy just before the New Year. Shane continues to amaze and inspire!He\\'s as active and happy as any 22 month old and it\\'s really rewarding to see. He is most proud of his new hair which has recently made an appearance. With your continued prayers and positive thoughts we will keep plugging away at his treatment. Thank you for all of your support donations well wishes prayers and love! We cannot thank you all enough! With loveThe O\\'Donnell Family+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Kathryn DaSilva 18 months ago Share August 30 2016It\\'s been a while since our last update but things have gone well. We have blown past the 7 month marker since Shane\\'s diagnosis and aren\\'t too interested in looking back. Shane completed his 2nd and final round of high dose chemotherapy and will receive his last stem cell transplant tomorrow. This has been a grueling summer with consecutive month long stays in the hospital but once he\\'s discharged we should be beyond the halfway point of his treatment. The high dose chemotherapy treatments he received essentially stripped him of his immune system so the stem cells help his body to begin reproducing the bone marrow and white blood cells he needs to fight off infections. It takes some time so he will be under many restrictions until December. After his body recovers from the transplant he will have a few weeks home and then he will begin radiation. We will learn more about that in the weeks to come. Through all of this Shane never ceases to amaze us. Somehow he manages to go through all of this will a smile on his face and a lot of love in his heart. He lights up every time he gets a chance to hug and kiss his sisters and they react the same way to him. We look forward to getting him home so he has the freedom to run around and play ball the way he loves to do. Thank you for all the continuous love prayers and support and thank you to all of the friends that have worked so hard to set up fundraising efforts and raised awareness.

Brianna got her dose of chemo and we headed to same day surgery for her port placement. Aside from a little tears before surgery the procedure went well and Brianna\\'s port was placed and is working without issue. Even better her picc line was removed she was so happy about that. The surgery lasted about an hour and 20 minutes and following recovery we headed home just before 5pm. She ate as soon as we got home she hadn\\'t eaten in like 13 hours so she was starving!! She is having some pain at her port site which is totally normal! She is a little groggy from being under so long. She is frustrated because she is having trouble finding a comfortable position to sleep. All of this is very temporary. I suspect by the end of the week she will feel 100% better. Today began the phase of her treatment called consolidation. In this phase she will go to clinic once a week. During these visits she will have a lumbar puncture so they can inject chemo into the spinal fluid. She will also take chemo in pill form every night for 28 days. The doctors have told us that she should have more good days than bad days in this phase of treatment. We are looking forward to that! .

We are STANDARD RISK!!! Woohoooo!! Thank you all for your continued prayers and kind words. This is definitely a victory!Standard Risk means there is no detectable leukemia left in her blood. She will still continue her phases of treatment over the next 2 years. However the acuity or intensity of the chemo is less than it would be with high risk. The other nice part is that she will not have to have anymore bone marrow aspirations unless they suspect there\\'s a reason to. I will be able to get a schedule of treatment that goes out a couple months. That\\'s such a big deal for me as I will be going back to work soon and I need to plan. We will be heading to Children\\'s tomorrow for her port placement. She\\'s going to get her picc line removed as well. She is beyond excited for that!! I talked with them today about taking it out while she\\'s under anesthesia so she\\'s doesn\\'t have to suffer through the dressing coming off her raw skin. They agreed that would be best. I am so relieved by that! A million thank you\\'s to all who have thought of Brianna. To all that have held her in prayer thank you for your faithfulness. I\\'ve said it before but I\\'m going to say it again..we have never felt alone through all of this!

It was pretty awful. Brianna\\'s poor arm was so raw and irritated.

She suffered through it and we finally got a different dressing on. I despised every second of it for her and am so grateful that the picc line will be coming out on Tuesday. She did bounce back a little in the afternoon. She sat with a couple visitors for a little over an hour. She laughed and joked with them...music to my ears .

She spent a good portion of the day coloring playing games and socializing! She had quite a busy day with visitors and she was able to keep up! Today was the first day in a long time that she has really felt like being active. The pain control plan that the docs came up with yesterday seemed to make all the difference today.

When Tina and I set up this gofundme it was with sort of mixed emotions knowing how hard it is to ask for help. As most of you know even when you have good medical insurance the expenses involved with this type of surgery and reconstruction continue to multiply.

Videos to come via my Facebook!+ Read MoreUpdate 42 Posted by Andrea Derflinger 10 months ago Share 11 Good morning everyone! It looks like May is going to be a GREAT month because I have some really exciting news! Becky is starting her FINAL chemo treatment today!! This is a 5 day treatment so she should be finished on Friday! Originally Becky was scheduled to complete her chemo treatments near the end of May but her doctor felt it would be best to keep her treatments symmetrical. I don\\'t know the details of the why or how behind this but the real take away here is that Becky is doing awesome and she\\'s almost DONE! Here is a note I received from Alicia this morning that Becky and her family would like me to share with you all:We are at the hospital for Becky\\'s FINAL chemo treatment!!! Looking back to our first treatment it seemed like an eternity to get through. We had some setbacks but through God\\'s grace and the prayers of so many wonderful people Becky has kept her strength and faith in God. Our journey continues with routine scans but we have so much hope gratitude and love in our hearts. We are ready to celebrate! Thank you so much to everyone who has been with us throughout this journey.Go wish my best friend luck during this final week!! YAY BECKY! We love you!A true warrior!!+ Read MoreUpdate 41 Posted by Andrea Derflinger 11 months ago Share Great news from Alicia! - At the hospital getting cycle #15 of 17. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The decision from the tumor board is that once chemo is completed Becky will be free to finish her schooling with NO additional surgery or radiation. She will be monitored by Dr.Kehoe and hopefully the cancer will stay away forever. We are in God\\'s hands as always and continually grateful for all the prayers!+ Read MoreUpdate 40 Posted by Andrea Derflinger 11 months ago Share Latest update from Alicia!Back again. This is round 14 of 17!!!! Can\\'t believe how well Becky has handled this treatment and I\\'m not alone her doctor is just as amazed. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Dr. Kehoe is presenting Becky\\'s case to the Sarcoma Tumor Board at UTSW in order to get input as to the plan after chemo. Becky has a lot of inspirational messages that you all have sent her and she likes to surround herself with them while in the hospital. I can see one right now.

We have been completely overwhelmed by the generosity and kindness and are beyond grateful. We are also thrilled to report that Isabella completed treatment in January. While our cancer journey is far from over we have started regaining some normalcy in our lives. Simply not having a planned hospital stay hanging over our heads has been such a blessing!Our next steps are continuous testing and monitoring for long term effects from the treatment and secondary cancers. She will also be having scans every 3 months to see if there is any new cancer growth. We live in fear each day that she will wake up with a new symptom or side effect but her amazing spirit and super happy disposition helps distract us from being consumed by fear.We have realized that having a little more down time now allows us to reflect and think back at all we have been through and it has understandably affected us all deeply. We are truly amazed at how far we have come and can’t believe we all survived 19 months of so much pain and suffering. One of the hardest parts as parents was trying to comfort Isabella by telling her everything was going to be OK when in reality there was nothing OK about it and we really didn’t know if it would be OK. We were so afraid of losing her trust. We wondered how she could possibly love us when we were allowing so many bad things to happen to her. Somehow at such a young age she seemed to have a greater understanding than we could ever comprehend. Going through such traumatic experiences has definitely made her wiser than her years.Sophia and Alexa are thrilled to have us home on a regular basis and for us to be able to do things together as a family. Even though we tried our best to keep life as normal as possible for them it was far from normal since we spent more time in the hospital than we did home for the past 2 years. They weren’t allowed in the Oncology Unit since they are under 12 so they were immediately isolated from their baby sister. Pediatric cancer is life changing for the entire family. Alexa’s dream is for no child to get cancer and have to spend so much time in the hospital!We are cautiously optimistic going forward. Unfortunately we have seen how quickly things can spiral downhill but being hopeful is the only way to move forward. Isabella is very excited to see her hair growing and says she really wants to go to pre-k. We are praying that Isabella can take her childhood back from cancer. We hope that in the near future no family will have to go through this which is why we have been working with the St. Baldrick’s Foundation. They fund research exclusively for pediatric cancer.

Love to all!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Jennifer Ieraci 25 months ago Share We can't believe it's been 8 months since Bella's diagnosis. We have definitely come a long way. She has truly been our rock throughout this journey. We continue to be amazed by her strength and resilience. She has completed 6 rounds of chemo major surgery to remove the primary tumor and high dose radiation therapy (this treatment was done at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia). The hardest part so far besides getting over the initial shock of her diagnosis was the surgery. It's so hard to completely entrust your babies life to a team of doctors and have absolutely no control! Looking back I don't know how we got through that day and the long 3 week recovery in the hospital. We couldn't have done it alone. We are so grateful for all the support and prayers of family and friends. Some of Sophia's classmates will be participating in the St. Baldrick's fundraiser in April and have decided to honor Isabella's brave fight! Their team is named Bella's Brigade and they are off to a great start . It's so heart warming to see kids helping other kids! St. Baldrick's is a wonderful organization for children's cancer research. If anyone is interested in donating to Bella's Brigade please visit www.stbaldricks.org/events/Trinity2016 then scroll down to Teams and click on Bella's Brigade.Thankfully Isabella is doing as well as we could hope for at this point but we still have a long road ahead. Some days the road feels endless. The next step is high dose chemo with a stem cell transplant to help her recover. Please continue to keep the prayers coming as we have heard from other families that this is a very difficult treatment. The doctors feel it's a necessary step to obtain the cure we are fighting so hard for!Many thanks!Celebrating Christmas!Wonderful quote sums it all up!Family holiday photo+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Today Benjamin Miller took what we hope and pray was his VERY LAST DOSE OF CHEMO! It\\'s a BIG day. Since July of 2015 Ben has had some sort of chemo running through his veins. At first it was to rid his body of the leukemia then it was to maintain remission then to kill every blood cell in his body and wipe his immunity clean in preparation for stem cell then once again as a maintenance for a 2 year period. There were 4 other chemos that were added along the way for graft vs host complications some worked some did more harm than good. This is the nature of cancer... 921 days we have SURVIVED! So today and every day we celebrate and we are grateful for those by our side. Now it\\'s time to HEAL! Ben\\'s body has literally been through hell so now it\\'s time to see what it can do on its own. I know my husband and he\\'s a fighter he will return to his former Mongo glory but perhaps a bit leaner. So to his firefighter brothers cheer him on together lets build him up and know that you\\'re all part of this success story. ? to you all the Millers #millerstrong #littlemillerstrong #mongostrong #cancersucks #lastdayofchemoMiller Strong+ Read MoreUpdate 37 Posted by Joy Ferguson 1 month ago Share 12/8/17 We got Ben\\'s most recent bone marrow results and once again we are grateful he\\'s still leukemia free! #Millerstrong #littlemillerstrong #cancersucks #2yearsfree3togoforthecure #AMLsurvivorDec 5 2017 Day 791: in Houston getting Benjamin followed up on after his hospitalization.

Praying for good results and a safe trip home.+ Read MoreUpdate 36 Posted by Joy Ferguson 20 months ago Share Day 259 results: Well Benjamin Miller didn\\'t get the news that we hoped for instead the GVHD (graft vs host disease) has spread it\\'s now in his mouth along with the facial rash. My first reaction was to feel defeated and like someone punched me in my stomach as we long so much for a \"\"normal\"\" where plans can be made and we don\\'t have to cancel them. Then I told myself don\\'t let the devil plant the seeds of doubt instead be gracious of how far we\\'ve come in this journey. I am so grateful that Ben is still in remission and though this may not be how I wanted to spend summer vacation again at least we are together as a family.Ben\\'s doctor is continuing him on the 2nd chemo and we are going to send up some really powerful prayers that in 2 weeks when we go back that the GVHD will be gone or at least improved enough that the doctor is comfortable with maintaining this treatment. If not the plan is to travel to Houston twice a week for treatment I don\\'t know what kind and go from there. Doc says that it\\'s not conducive to a full time job and with Ben being our only source of income this will put us at God\\'s mercy. I have started my job search however my hopes were to not return to work until the kids went back to school. So I\\'m laying it all in God\\'s hands.Thank you all for your continued support love and especially your prayers. ?#?mongostrong? ?#?millerstrong? ?#?littlemillerstrong?\"\"Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not be faint.\"\" Isaiah 40:28-31+ Read MoreUpdate 35 Posted by Joy Ferguson 22 months ago Share Day 210 update: 1st I want to say thank you all for the prayers we are truly experiencing devine intervention today. We made it safely with minimal slowdowns. As we were about to pull into parking garage Bens PA called and said they forgot to schedule labs could he be there a little early he told her we were there so she knew we were early and could watch for his labs. So we head up to the waiting room to start our 2.5 hour wait for our \"\"appointment time\"\" (I say this in quotes as we are usually waiting about 2 hours past our appt time). They called him back after only about 30 min. Now we are heading home and thankfully HOV lane was open so we could avoid a slowdown from a wreck.So results of today\\'s visit: they are lowering his maintenance chemo dose by 1/2 and prescribing a vamped up B6 complex to hopefully help alleviate Bens hand and foot syndrome (they look extremely painful so please pray over his hands and feet). They are tapering his predisone steroids that were prescribed after last visit showing he had a GVHD (graft vs host disease) rash. His electolytes were off today low potassium so they weren\\'t sure what to make of that but weren\\'t overly concerned with it. His liver enzymes looked much better this visit compared to last they were elevated previously and they wanted to monitor. His hemoglobin was 12.9 so that was good (normal is 16) his platelets dropped to 127 not terrible but down from 146 (normal is 140+) and absolute neutrophils were 4.9 (normal is 4.0+). A bone marrow biopsy will be done in about a month and we\\'ll follow up with Dr in about 5 weeks.Now we\\'re journeying home to relieve gramma Lee who always saves us and gets kids from bus on appointment days. Talked to Anais and she was super happy to hear we\\'ll be home earlier than planned.Thank you all for your love and prayers they are our Amazing Grace. ?#?millerstrong? ?#?mongostrong? ?#?littlemillerstrong?+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I personally don\\'t know if I\\'m open to the change but it\\'s supposed to be better for post mentapause and also decrease my likelihood of blood clots and other cancers ( Feedback would be great if anyone has taken it).

As of now I\\'ve made it through 18 radiation and am supposed to have 27 ...however I am the lucky 9 out of 10 who also will be getting a \"\" boost\"\" ( extra radiation in a smaller area). Sadly I don\\'t know how many more radiation treatments that really means. And I don\\'t know if this is good or bad but in just 2 months I met my 5000 plus deductible...thank you Cancer the gift that like to take you to the poor house. Other then that I have a few upcoming appointments with my medical oncologist to decide which of 2 meds I want to be on for the next 10 years. I also am lucky enough to finally found a surgical gynecologist oncologist who hasn\\'t cancelled on me 3 times and hopefully will be the one to remove everything but my cervix. And lastly but not least I also get to see my dermotologist to make sure that my skin is dealing well with everything and that my many of years in the sun. ..playing and tanning did not do to much damage. So yeah as of now that\\'s where I stand. Hope you all are enjoying the extra day we have this year! + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I\\'ve been wanting to post an update for a while now and finally today is the day! I wanted to update you with THE BIGGEST THANK YOU IN THE WORLD!!! THANK YOU GOFUNDME FAMILY! THANK YOU for getting me through a REALLY tough hospital stay with surgeries and crazy long nights! All the support coming in from here during that time took away what\\'s always my biggest challenge next to the CANCER..and it\\'s financial worry. Laying in a hospital bed thinking that the rent was not paid yet before I was dumped in there for a week...was scary. I didn\\'t have the money to cover it for January and you all made it possible! THATS WHY THE BIGGEST THANK YOU IN THE WORLD FOR YOU ALL!!! I sometimes wish my words could express what emotions I feel in my heart. I am filled with gratitude and love and truly feel blessed to have this support system to save me and the kids. That\\'s what you are all doing. I want you all to think about yourselves today..it\\'s Sunday...(yes SuperBowl) but also the holy day if the week :) so take time today like I am and will lots and think about how compassionate you are. Be proud that you helped me and the kids keep OUR HOME our HEAT our FOOD our LIGHTS ON our PETS fed and that all most importantly KEEPS US TOGETHER. Words can\\'t express my gratitude for that. They just can\\'t. It\\'s so beautiful what you all have done and continued to do. I want you to know that I thank you. Everyday I thank you. This is definitely the hardest battle I have had yet with this cancer. We\\'ve been boxing partners for about 12 years now..I won a few rounds back in the day and actually held a belt for a few years!!!! But it\\'s sad to say I am the underdog this match. I\\'m fully aware of it and I don\\'t let it stop me. Underdogs can win it and those are always the best stories! Not giving up. No way! Just have to fight a lot harder this time and I am.I try. A quick medical update for you and then I may go back to sleep....zzzzSince discharge from the hospital about a week ago (I had to have surgery near my heart...pericardial effusion...basically the cancer cells attacked the fluid around my heart causing it to make way too much and cause intense pain and pressure in my shoulder and chest area..also caused my heart to be in major distress. Drs cut me open and drained fluid during procedure and then they had implanted an external drain to a pump for a few days to continue the draining. Once they were confident the drain came out and I came home with a brand new knarley chest scar and literally 20 medications a day and I inject 2 shots a day into my belly because I developed blood clots in my lungs from all this stuff happening) To date I have completed 8 whole brain radiation treatments! I have 2 more to go!!! Sooooo excited about that being COMPLETE! I finish on Tuesday wih my mom and we are going for pancakes! LolThen on February 9th Monday...I start weekly chemo treatments indefinitely. The chemo is called Taxol. That witch and I are old friends. I had a few rounds of her back in 2003. So back trying her out. Hopefully she will be some my friend and get this cancer under control without making my life too miserable. I am optimistic. I know my oncologist could of picked an even meaner witch off the shelf to give me...so I will count my blessings for a weekly round with her.My Dr. always tells me my biggest risk is infection. So I will be laying low for a while during this. Have to keep germs away. Keep sending me positive notes to read! Happy SuperBowl Sunday BUT most importantly...DONT FORGET....THINK ABOUT HOW AWESOME YOU ARE TODAY SUNDAY!Because YOU AREEEEEEE!I LOVE YOU ALL!I will be sending each of you a special thank you very soon for each of your generous donations.XoxoDana Marie + Read MoreUpdate 19 Posted by Kare Cares 38 months ago Share hopefully these two treatment plans will help get my cancer under control fast. Being in the hospital over the past week it has been shown that my brain metastases have grown and spread as well as my lung metastases. I have no choice but to take this treatment option so I can fight back for more time here with my loved ones. If I don\\'t do this radiation I was told within two weeks I will have severe debilitating irreversible brain issues...So..full speed ahead I guess.Have to keep on fighting. My mom is taken a leave of absence from her career at Mountainside Hopsital to take care of me and my kids. I am so blessed to have a mom like this. Please pray for her as well because being the main caregiver (since I have no husband) is not an easy job. She loves me unconditionally so I know it doesn\\'t seem that way for her. I worry about her taking on the bulk of this so please pray for me the kids and my mom to get through this horrible horrible nightmare.I won\\'t give up. I won\\'t back down. I need to be here for my kids as long as the drs can keep me alive! That\\'s my strength. Ashley & Mikey Need me as much as I need them. So I pray for a speedy recovery from brain radiation and pray for chemo to go easy on my little body.Amen! Thank you all so much!XOXO Love Dana I am using the words of good old Pat Benatar to get me through the next phase.

       " \"Update 10 Posted by Michael Montoya Jr. 40 months ago Share 11 Thanks to everyone that has donated to my cause. I finished my 3 round of Chemo on the October 9th 2014. My Oncology doctor has now referred me to Colorado Blood Cancer Institute for my Stem Cell Transplant. This procedure involves collecting healthy stem cells from the patient and freezing them. They are then stored and the patient receives a high dose of chemotherapy. After the patient receives Chemo through an IV the stem cells are then infused back into the patient to restore marrow function blood counts and the immune system I am currently going through tests so the doctors can determine if I am a good candidate for this procedure. If I am I will be admitted the day before Thanksgiving 2014 for a 30 to 40 day stay.....Then discharged home where for 45-100 days will be Neutropenia ( a non-existent immune system).

       " 'Update 27 Posted by Anna Marie Stenberg 8 months ago Share Here a wonderful update From Lynda\"It\\'s been a year since my last MRI. Last weeks\\'s scan came back \"very clean\" meaning no sign of cancer! Awesome right? Dr Yom was quite happy as was I. She is replacing Dr Garsa who\\'s been my main radiation doc for the last 18 months & I\\'ll miss him. She\\'s consulted all along with him so is part of my team.I just passed a major milestone. With this type of cancer & my case a critical time is 3-14 months from the last day of treatment for recurrence of cancer. I\\'m now 15 months out which puts me in another (more likely to live) category. As you are aware the severity of the cancer plus heavy doses of radiation have caused serious collateral damage. My tongue has atrophied & right side is paralyzed still has sores & rawness (& pain). My throat & esophagus are more narrow now & the epiglottis melted to the right inhibiting speech & swallowing leading to aspiration.In spite of all that I can now manage to swallow 4T by mouth. How delicious to feel cold creamy coconut milk in my mouth! Or warm miso soup or \"cream\" soups. I even diluted some non-dairy yogurt with rice milk & got that down little by little (muscles tire easily). Yay. That is huge to me. None of the experts is sure if I\\'ll get off the tube though I work toward that.Last month I ended up in the Parnassus ER for 12 hrs with extreme abdominal pain (CT showed no obstruction) bleeding dehydration & a tube which nearly fell out. A new one was installed (# 3) & a month later the cap on the end is starting to give out. Apparently they often are replaced within 3 months. Dang. Maybe I should be hired as a \"tester\" of tube viability. ha. My speech is improving I am told. Two new developments there. I now have a new tool for PT exercises called an Ora-Stretch which will mechanically pry my mouth open further. Right now I can open to 38 cm which is 2 cm from where I should be. A while back the dr couldn\\'t get a tongue depressor on its side into my mouth (an inch). Progress. Last week I was fitted for a prosthesis to lower the palate & give my tongue something to play against. It MAY help with G\\'s & K\\'s but not much more. We were astonished to find out Medicare will pay (medical device not dental). Speaking of I\\'ve had my 1st teeth cleaning back in March though aspiration happens as the chair is leaned back. It took this long to be able to open wide enough. I am convinced the PT helps. A few too many days of not doing it & I can\\'t open as wide.The last 2 months I\\'ve been trying to document my dairy allergy for Medicare to pay for my \"food\". Unfortunately tests are inconclusive (just because I have milk antibodies doesn\\'t prove anything). I was about to head to Santa Rosa for a skin prick test when my dietitian from the food distributor called saying she found another similar product only far superior. Because it is not considered a specialty item (I use \"Diabetisource\" & am not a diabetic) Medicare will cover it. It\\'s organic fruits & veggies NO CORN SYRUP only rice syrup & agave more vitamins & minerals & protein. Originated by a family farm with a cerebral palsy child on a tube. This is what I hoped for-I am stoked!The fatigue is about the same but I work around it. The neuropathy usually right arm/shoulder/hand is with me daily & makes sleeping fitful. But here I am enjoying another beautiful summer day all 110# of me! ha.

Please share.From Lynda\"Time for an update:My Speech Pathologist said I wasn\\'t able to get my mouth as open as the last appt. So I have 5-6 new exercises to add to the repertoire. He wondered why my speech clarity fluctuates. The dr said the inflammation can take 6 months to subside. That affects swallowing & speech of course. We\\'re hoping the tumor & radiation damage is temporary esp to the tongue nerve & muscles. I will have to be vigilant about the exercises to prevent my jaw mouth & neck from \"locking up\". Maybe this will just be a regular part of my life (PT) as we want to avoid the stiffening that sometimes occurs @ 10 yrs. Still lots of mucous & spitting going on.When Dr Garsa shared the CT/PET results he had a big smile on his face. He said there is \"no visible sign of cancer\" in my body. He said this is the \"best of outcomes. We couldn\\'t be more pleased with the results!\" Esp so early on. This was a very hard to reach cancer.

Next is to see the UCSF oncological dentist for an exam & cleaning (insurance doesn\\'t cover & she\\'s expensive) which I\\'ll always need 3-4x/yr. Radiation makes teeth brittle. No extractions or root canals ever for me from now on or osteonecrosis can set in where the jaw can break off. Eww gross! I need to take extra care of my teeth as I\\'m more prone to cavities now.

I wanted to let people know that everything has been going very well. I had another pet scan a couple of weeks ago and all of the detectable cancer is gone. The doctors have said that I only have to come to Phoenix for treatment every five weeks. I am very happy about this. My progress is very miraculous really no other word comes to mind. As usual I would like to say how much I appreciate all of the support of so many people who cared to reach out in so many ways. Not the least of which I would like to express my gratitude to the staff at Euro-med integrative oncology clinic in Phoenix. They are doing miracles every day. Another reason I mention Euro-med is that many people have asked what I did and where I went to have such an amazing result. If I can answer any questions for you or your loved ones I am very happy to do so.I also would like to take this opportunity to let people know that I have subdivided the property where I live and I am selling a very beautiful view lot to help recover financially from this extremely expensive course of treatments. If anyone knows someone looking for exceptional view property in the Homer Alaska area please be sure to have them contact me. Thank you very much Bill+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Kenton Bloom 11 months ago Share Dear family and friends since my last update of a month ago I have been continuing intensive treatments. I finally finished with that. It has been a long five months. I am now moving into the maintenance phase. This means that instead of living in Arizona and coming home twice I will be living at home and making frequent trips to Arizona. I will start with going every two weeks and then every three weeks and so on depending on how I am doing with the hopes of going months between treatments if all goes well. The doctors are very positive about how I have responded to treatments. It is great to be home and I am feeling good. I have been skiing every day and visiting with friends. Again Amy and I want to thank everyone for the continued love and support. I hope to see you all soon so I can thank you in person. Love Bill+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Kenton Bloom 12 months ago Share Hi friends and family Amy and I met with doctors last week to hear what they had to say about my latest pet scan and cancer marker blood test. It was very encouraging. They said that they haven't seen anyone respond to treatment as well as I have and that I should be dancing a jig on the table. But... (there is always a but) the cancer is greatly diminished gone almost everywhere that it had spread but not completely gone so they want me to continue intensive treatments for another month. EEEK. They feel that if I continue with my foot on it's throat for another month I will significantly reduce the chance for it to gain a toe hold to try and start coming back. We have been visiting family in Colorado and Tennessee and will head back to Arizona in a few days. Thanks to everyone for the continued support. Bill+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 5 Posted by Suzanne Beaubien 43 months ago Share Hi friends I have the latest update from Jen on Ellis\\' condition. There\\'s some good news in there so read on for a mostly happy update!\"\"Today (Wednesday) is a big day for Ellis. Yesterday her neutrophil (white blood cell) count was at 1100 (which is awesome considering she was at zero just a week ago!). Her red cells and platelets are also good and a CT scan may have found the source of her recent fevers. Ellis\\'s kidneys and spleen have a fungal infection. So she has a different anti-fungal med and it will take a while to clear up but hopefully this will end the fevers! Momma got to go get a haircut and spend time away from the hospital at a dinner with an old friend and go to the Brighter Tomorrows meeting with Quinn! It was a great day! Hoping we may soon become outpatient patients staying at the Ronald McDonald House!Tomorrow is Ellis\\'s big test day. Hopefully early in the day she will have her spinal tap bone marrow biopsy a urine collection via in-and-out catheter and an ultrasound to see if they can pick up the kidney and spleen infections on there--there is less radiation than a CT scan. The urine test is new--something it is tough to get from a non-potty trained toddler but the catheter will not stay in. The goal of the other two procedures is to see if the leukemia blasts are at the hoped for level of 0.01 or less (at day eight Ellis\\'s rate was 0.012). We\\'re hoping and praying for good results--please send up a prayer for the same! Thank you all for the continued support!+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Suzanne Beaubien 44 months ago Share The latest update from Jen: \"\"Ellis ended up getting another blood transfusion and had three fevers today. The fevers necessitated blood cultures--one of which the lab techs screwed up and came back for a third blood sample (they better not let that happen again; Momma Bear was about to get really vocal the first time--a second time I\\'m talking to the lab manager; my baby doesn\\'t have extra blood to spare!). Neutrophils were at 20 again red blood cells were just on the cusp (7.2 when the doctors want 7 or better before transfusing) platelets were good at 52-57ish (don\\'t recall the exact number)...good news overall. Because of feeling just so icky Ellis again spent most of the day in bed sleeping and watching movies. I\\'ve managed to get her out of bed a little bit each of the last two days but she is just so listless and sad-looking that I try to let her have the rest and calm she seems to need. I hate to see what tomorrow\\'s dose of chemo is going to do to her moods appetite and activity level. The doctor\\'s tell me she is doing good but this is not my baby girl anymore--it is so hard to watch her lay in bed and just zone out.I\\'ve tried hard to hide the fact that I\\'m so sad about how Ellis is feeling so I\\'ve tried to be a little more silly and a little more playful with Ellis. It is the most difficult thing I\\'m doing--I want to break down into tears as soon as she smiles (which I did see some smiles about five times today)!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Suzanne Beaubien 44 months ago Share The most recent update from Ellis\\' mom Jen: \"\"Today was more of yesterday: sleeping movies whining (though significantly less whining). Neutrophil numbers are up to 20 today; red cells and platelets are both good too. Ellis had a fever this afternoon so we are waiting for results on a blood culture to see if there is an infection; the fever is gone now after Tylenol. Hopefully it stays away and the fever was the result of something non-infectious. However she also has thrush (we believe) so she is on niacin for that now. At least she takes that pretty well.\"\"+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Suzanne Beaubien 44 months ago Share Update from Jen on July 15 2014: \"\"Today was a good day overall though it started out quite stressful. We were trying to get Ellis to take two of her meds via pill form (instead of the IV and icky liquid forms)--and we pushed too hard. She was taking it crushed in applesauce and chasing it with apple juice but it was a real struggle. After finally getting the last bite in her mouth she gagged and everything came back out. One of my worst mothering moments of this journey so far--I was the motor behind the spoon and cup. The crying bath that came after was miserable for everyone involved.This mess followed the depressing news that the doctor misspoke yesterday. She said Ellis\\'s neutrophils were 200 yesterday (out of the needed 500) but she added an extra zero. So we were only at 20 of 500. Today\\'s numbers were up to 30 so that\\'s positive but tomorrow\\'s chemotherapy is expected to decrease the number again. So again we are at the bottom.\"\"+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 17 Posted by Justine Zuniga 29 months ago Share Update and some knowledge :)On October 2nd 2014 I had my very first round of chemo. September 17th 2014 is when I got the call that my lump was cancer. Since I first found my lump I\\'ve had four biopsies one surgical procedure I\\'ve been on 6 different chemo drugs had 17 rounds of chemo and five big surgeries. It\\'s been one crazy roller coaster.This past Tuesday October 6th I had my fifth and last surgery. I underwent a Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy. The surgery went well and although they need to run pathology on my ovaries my doctor is confident everything will come back clean. I was sent home yesterday (a day ahead of schedule) to recover with bed rest. Recovery will take 4-6 weeks but then I\\'ll be able to start focusing on the rest of my life because the hardest parts are over!!! No more surgeries no more chemo!I want to thank everyone for your support this past year. I like doing things on my own and planned on going through all of this privately but I\\'m so glad I listened to my family and didn\\'t because I needed the help. I wouldn\\'t have made it through this without so many of you! It\\'s been a hard year physically emotionally and financially and you have all helped lighten the burden a little. I know it will be a while but I can\\'t wait to get back on my feet both physically and financially so I can help others the way you all have helped me.October is breast cancer awareness month. You see pink everywhere during October. While I love that breast cancer is being talked about Pink October is done more as a trend and less as awareness. I think most people know a few basics of what breast cancer is. We\\'re all \"\"aware\"\" that breast cancer exists. What should be highlighted during this month are the amount of false facts out there and the amount of young people who are getting breast cancer. There is a woman in my support group who is only 26 with breast cancer. A doctor of mine is treating a woman for breast cancer who is only 21. Yes if you\\'re over fifty you should be getting yearly mammograms but if you\\'re younger you should be checking your breasts regularly too! I didn\\'t go to the doctor right away because everything I read said I was too young and lacked a family history.Well my lump was breast cancer. I wasn\\'t too young because there is no such thing as too young. Although I lacked a family history I still carried the deadly BRCA2 gene mutation which gave me an 80% chance of getting breast cancer and a 40% chance of ovarian cancer.Know your body and if you feel anything abnormal in your breasts don\\'t hesitate to get it checked! Yes breast cancer detected early has a great survival rate and a lot of funding but advanced and metastatic breast cancer does not. There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer and even if you are diagnosed early and treated early your cancer can come back metastatic.If you have an immediate family member who has had breast cancer or the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutation you need to get checked for the gene so you know what you\\'re up against. I don\\'t want something like this to happen to you.With that said the gene mutation is very rare so if you don\\'t have the mutation that does not mean you\\'re free and clear. Only 5-10% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have the gene mutation.Bottom line: Know your breasts check them regularly and don\\'t hesitate to get them checked by your doctor even if you think what you\\'re feel is probably nothing. Yes it\\'s scary but early detection could save your life!I just want these few facts out there because as we see ads focusing on women over fifty getting breast cancer or campaigns telling us to \"\"fight like a girl\"\" and \"\"save the ta-tas\"\" important facts are slipping through the cracks and it\\'s a huge disservice to young women (and men) everywhere.You know your body the best so trust your instincts.If you want more information on breast cancer go to:Breastcancer.orgNccn.orgMbcn.orgLoveJustine+ Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Justine Zuniga 29 months ago Share Hi everyone! It\\'s Justine and I want to share with you the message I shared on my Facebook page today:#tbt I\\'m throwing it back to October 2nd 2014 with my pink hair on my first day of chemo. So many feelings took over me that day but I chose to be optimistic. Flash forward to today and I am sitting at my very last chemo treatment!!! While I love the nurses here I\\'m so happy to not have to show up here again in three weeks :) God is good! October 6th is my last surgery and after that long recovery I\\'ll hopefully get this port removed <3Have a great Thursday!!!LoveJustine+ Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by Justine Zuniga 30 months ago Share Update on the last couple months!http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/justinegiacchetti/journal/view/id/55e08ef9a689b4421e5aef4d+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Justine Zuniga 33 months ago Share We want to take a moment to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts to the family friends and strangers who have donated prayed for and shared Justine’s story in an effort to help our sister during this trialing time. She is very grateful and appreciative for every bit of outpouring of love and plans to pay it forward someday when this is all in life’s rear-view mirror!The past eight months came and went; occupied with countless doctor’s appointments treatments tests and surgeries. There\\'s a flickering light at the end of this tunnel but Justine still has some trials to tackle before coming out on the other side. While most of these things were scheduled and Justine was “prepared” for them she’s also had some unwelcome events occur along the way. Most recently needing emergency surgery to remove her appendix last month requiring her to stay overnight in the hospital. In addition to the added expenses the last 2 surgeries in her cancer treatment plan have now forcibly been pushed back. She will also continue to receive Herceptin treatments through her chemo port every 3 weeks and hopefully still be finished with them in October like originally planned. Along with more doctor appointments tests physical therapy and any other treatments added to aid in the healing process. We pray that the worst is behind her and that no more setbacks will alter her plan for recovery. We are also thankful that the cancer has not appeared present anywhere else in Justine’s body. We are humbled by this and know that this is not often the case for others. Throughout this journey (journey implies something fun; but I digress) Justine has remained optimistic and kept a sense of humor about what she’s going through. To those of you that follow her caring bridge updates her disposition is evident in the posts she shares. She has been an amazing example to her children and to our family of what both physical and emotional strength are. However this has been no easy feat. Her faith continues to be tested time and time again and it’s fair to assume it must be difficult for her to try and remain strong through it all. Planning activities to make the summer memorable for her children including a road-trip gave Justine something to focus on and look forward to during some of her darkest days. The daydreams she had for a mostly treatment free summer with her kids is now overshadowed by the reality of what the summer is actually going to be like for her. Just like that summer is now here and Justine is not finished with her treatments. Her treatments are not on track as originally planned and her finances have taken a hard hit to say the least along the way. Although Justine is employed her ability to work is limited and she is confined to working from home right now. Unfortunately she is unable to seek employment outside of the home until her surgeries and treatment are over. With both regular and medical bills piling up daily Justine is overwhelmed with thoughts of how she is going to pay her bills knowing full and well that she won’t even be able to begin tackling them until she is healthy again. Nevertheless life doesn’t stop. Her kids are done with school and are eager to spend quality time with their momma. Justine’s soul craves to be a part of this delicate time in her kids’ lives where they still desire to spend their free time with her. We want nothing more for this to come to fruition; to help lift the spirits of both Justine and her kids. If you know Justine then you know that she HATES asking for help and almost never asks for it. But she never said we couldn’t ask for her ?! So... we are asking that you please share her story. Share it through Facebook Twitter Instagram Email and whatever other social media sites you can. When you share ask your friends to share too. We know that so many of you have already helped in one way or another and that some of you cannot afford to help financially but sharing this post is helping too! If your news feeds are flooded with her story then we have accomplished what we’ve set out to do. The more lives Justine’s story reaches the more opportunities Justine has for her own life to be blessed. God only gave us one Justine - an amazing sister mother daughter friend and so much more - we want other’s to be fortunate enough to know her too.So please if you feel led share her GoFundMe page one more time.With love & gratitudeThe Giacchetti Family+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 6 Posted by Brian Lane 40 months ago Share *PLEASE READ ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE COMING TONIGHT*Well the day has finally arrived. It feels like I have been patiently waiting for this day to come forever. Since the moment I announced I was doing this fight and what I was fighting for the support has been absolutely amazing. Phone calls emails and countless text came flooding in along with an overwhelming display of generosity and love from all of you. The fact we were able to raise well over $6000 is absolutely incredible. Every last one of you will be getting a personal note of thanks from me so please know that I have seen all of the donations and all of the messages and they mean the world to me. Tonight you are going to see a bunch of people who have worked their tails off grew a big set of metaphorical balls and agreed to walk into the ring for the first time (for most of us). We are not fighters we are not people looking to break onto the boxing scene; we are just people who fell in love with a workout and decided to see what it’s like to get in the ring look our opponent right in the eyes and say give me your best shot because here comes mine. This fundraiser should not take anything away from all of the hard work everyone else has put in and I want to personally congratulate every single one of the fighters for getting to this point tonight. Tonight is about so much more than my mother and her fight. It is about everyone who has fought the good fight and everyone who has been negatively impacted by it. I always tell people that my mom getting breast cancer was the best worst thing that could have ever happened to my family and me. It put everything into a new perspective it made me appreciate life and know that we are not invincible and that the stat of 1 in 8 women is a very real stat that can hit far too close to home. This is a fight against all cancer a show of respect for everyone who has fought and is fighting. So for all of you reading this right now send up positive vibes thoughts prayers whatever you want to call it for the people fighting and their families. I know that for me another close friend was put in the line of fire recently and he and his family will be heavy on my mind and heart tonight as I fight. I just want to say thanks again to all of you. I have so many friends I want to name right now who have been in my corner all along but the list would be far too long. Just know I love all of you and appreciate everything you’ve said and done for me. Tonight I am going to go out and give this fight my absolute all. I cannot wait to go out and compete again and put my hard training on display. This fight is for the loved ones lost to cancer the loved ones fighting cancer and the loved ones who were lucky enough to get through cancer. Keep fighting the good fight and we will all always be here in your corner ready to do anything needed to get you through it. One Love-Brian aka “The Boxing Polar Bear” PS. If you plan on coming to the fight tonight the address is 4000 Webster Avenue. Sadly Xavier has their home opener tonight as well and as many of you know the Cintas Center is very close to the Punch House. My phone will be off starting at 4 so I apologize if you call me for help. I will say this carpool call a cab pack a cooler and come early. There is a park called Lower Milcrest Park that has a few parking lots you can park in as well. Also there is street parking on Hopkins Ave. See you all tonight! + Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Brian Lane 40 months ago Share We are exactly one week away from the \"\"Big fight\"\". I can\\'t thank you enough for the support and words of encouragement I have received from so many. This entire fight and this fundraiser is so much more than dollars and punches. The driving motivating factor behind all this is awareness. To be so obnoxiously in your face about early detection that you can\\'t help but think to remind loved ones to get checked. If I did not raise a single penny but helped remind someone to get checked and it saved them then my true goal was reached. Please share my story because A. it\\'s a fantastic read if I do say so myself and B. Early detection is real. 1 in 8 women are effected by. Breast cancer. That is staggering. As for the fight I have been busting my butt because I refuse to let anyone down. I\\'ve played in some huge football games I\\'ve participated in competitive sports since the age of 6 and never have I been so nervous. It\\'s a new experience and has been a fun ride thus far. Feel free to come out to The Punchhouse and watch my self along with everyone else put our handwork on display. Thanks again for the support. One love.-The Boxing Polar Bear + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Brian Lane 41 months ago Share Well ladies and gentleman. Here is the end of the week update. At this point we have raised $5241!!! I want to give a huge thank you to a ton of my parents friends. Some I know some I have never met who have stepped up big time. It\\'s clearly a testament to 1. How amazing Holly Lane is so many people willing to donate in her name and 2. How awesome and generous all of you are. Every donation share and/or kind words from you all means so much! We are a little less than a month out and needless to say the training has stepped up significantly. You all have made it so that I have no choice but to show up and give the best possible performance I am capable of. There is still so much time to share my family\\'\\'s story. To me awareness is just as big if not bigger than dollars donated. Early detection is what kept my mother here...continue to have your loved ones get their annual check ups! Let\\'s keep this momentum going! Let\\'s share this with as many people as possible. Let\\'s get this story viral through the cincinnati circles! Hope you all have an amazing weekend!! Ps. This was written on my cell phone in a Perkins in Cleveland. Don\\'t judge any grammatical errors on me it\\'s the air in Cleveland causing the mistakes. + Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Brian Lane 41 months ago Share *PLEASE READ* So this is my last daily update...I will begin to cut it back to just weekly updates from here on out in order to not overwhelm your news feeds. I just want to say from the bottom of my heart thank you. these first few days have been nothing short of amazing. We are almost at $4000!!!!! The calls text and kind words from so many of you mean so much to me. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it was going to take off like this. I wont lie I was a little nervous about putting my story my true feelings out there like this but so many of you have made me feel so good about doing it. So again thank you all so much for every dollar and for every share. I just ask you all to please please please continue sharing this with coworkers family and friends. Not necessarily for donations but just for the simple awareness. Early detection is what saved my mom. Early detection is everything in this battle. PLEASE share my story with as many people as possible!!!! Thank you all!One Love Brian Lane + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I've lowered the goal since we have received some outside checks sent to us to help out with or move and to give us the freedom to do little things/trips work the kids as you treatment allows.We officially go and switch treatment to Duke on April 5th and get the keys to our rental at Fort Bragg on April 10th and will then officially be back in NC for a few years.Thank you from everyone who has helped us! We are truly appreciative of the support and help from friends family and even strangers. Hopefully I can beat this and we can get to a place where we are able to pass it on and help someone else in need. ---------------UPDATE: we are now moved to Fort Bragg and getting settled and traveling to Duke weekly for care. I've met with my new team there and have had 2 weeks of chemo treatments there so far (7 total). 5 more weeks of taxol and in 2 weeks I will receive one more dose of carboplatin if my numbers stay in a good range. Last week before my 7th chemo treatment my oncologist ordered an ultrasound of my lymph nodes that tested positive for cancer when they did biopsies before starting treatment in Georgia. After 6 weeks of chemo they decreased in size by 50%. They are unable to measure the cancer in my breast via ultrasound because they removed the main tumor before we knew it was cancer thinking it was a cyst/clogged milk duct. Usually they'd be able to track it shrinking growing or staying the same but with all the changes from the surgery they cannot conclusively tell what's residual cancer and what's changes from surgery. At the end of the taxol chemo treatments before I start the other two chemos they will do another ultrasound of the same lymph nodes to check again. I've been very blessed to bounce back after chemo so far and not get too sick like some people do on this chemo drug. Hopefully I don't plateau and treatment continues to kill this cancer :) As of now the treatment plan is:So after these 12 weeks of taxol (every third week adding a dose of carboplatin) I will then do 8 weeks of two other chemo treatments every other week so 4 more treatments. Then the surgeon will do a single mastectomy on the left (cancerous) side. Then after about 4 weeks of recovery they will do 6 weeks of radiation (5 days a week) on the left cancerous side. Then after 6 months if all is well the surgeon will do a preventative mastectomy on the right side with reconstruction to both sides all in the same surgery. Long road ahead. Thank you all for the prayers and help!! We really appreciate it!!!! --------------------------Update as of 7/7/17:Met with my oncologist and had another ultrasound of my lymph nodes positive for cancer this week as well as my 3rd week (out of 4 total) of adrimyocen and cytoxan chemo infusions. The ultrasound showed my lymph nodes are starting to look more normal meaning chemo appears to continue to be doing its job :) when I first met my oncologist she wouldn't give me survival statistics and has always strayed away from giving me survival odds when I ask and said to wait and see how chemo goes. She told me she is very happy with the ultrasound scans and thinks by the time I finish chemo she expects when they do surgery most of the cancer may already be gone :) just her guess based on what they are seeing. They unfortunately cannot really tell what's going on in the affected breast because the main tumor was removed prior to cancer diagnoses and they didn't get clear margins and left residual cancer behind that's hard to know what it's doing without Pet-CTs which is extra radiation I don't need right now based on cancer in the lymph nodes appearing decrease in size. Once chemo is done the surgeon and my oncologist will order additional scans.I am scheduled to have my LAST chemo infusion July 19th and also meet with my surgeon to go over options and meet again with my oncologist to check in. Surgery should be about 4 weeks following my last chemo and then 6 weeks of radiation 4ish weeks following that. Still so much more treatment left but it's a good feeling almost being done with chemo!!!Thank you for the continued prayers and support!

Brenda was supposed to have 12 chemo sessions but they decided to shorten this. This was partly because the chemo wasn\\'t shrinking it quite as much as they thought and because the chemo was lowering her immune system to a point where they were needing to skip planned chemo sessions. This wasn\\'t a bad thing just a thing that warranted changing plans. So Brenda\\'s surgery got moved up from late July to today June 28th. She is in surgery as I type this. The plan is for her to go home tomorrow cancer free! The recovery time from surgery is about 4-6 weeks. After surgery she will start radiation and eventually (probably early 2018) she will have reconstruction surgery. Thank you for everyone\\'s continued love and support!

Her breathing is easier the fluid around her left lung seems to be reducing and she says she\\'s running at half-capacity just hanging out on the couch seeing friends and doing occasional errands. But that\\'s an improvement over her pre-diagnosis life. Back then she was dragging herself through simple daily activities like driving a car and...well breathing...without wearing herself out.Due to her low energy levels Brenda has not gone back to work as she had hoped to do and we don\\'t know if that is going to be possible. For now she\\'s still learning to take it one day at a time which for a go-getter and big-time traveler like her is a poignant lesson.Donations continue to trickle in and for that we are very thankful. These will boost Brenda\\'s bank account for the unforeseeable future. Anchorage folks I will keep you updated in future posts on a local fundraiser/concert event being planned for May.Till then we hope to see Brenda back up and at it soon. Springtime is just around the corner in Alaska which means summer is just around the corner from that. She\\'s a solar-powered kind of gal so here\\'s hoping the sun comes quickly this year.

On November 17 2016 I had the High Intensity Focused Ultrasound procedure to treat prostate cancer. I was told that I would need to have a PSA test every 3 months. What is the PSA test?Prostate-specific antigen or PSA is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man’s blood. For this test a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The blood level of PSA is often elevated in men with prostate cancer and the PSA test was originally approved by the FDA to monitor the progression of prostate cancer in men who had already been diagnosed with the disease.When diagnosed with prostate my PSA was over 6. The normal range for a man is 0-4. The results from my first PSA test is 1.2. This is a great indicator that the HIFU has been successful. Once again I want to express my gratitude for your thoughtfulness and support.+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by Walt Parks 15 months ago Share It was Thursday November 17th I underwent the High Intensity Focused Ultrasound procedure. It was made possible by the generous donations of Big Hearted family friends and total strangers. I am doing awesome. I am back in the gym leading Spinning classes and working out. My massage clients are happy with being able to get therapy. I am looking forward with confidence to the results of my PSA test in three months. Dr Tracy Gapin and his team are fantastic and provided me with professional and caring service. Several have asked if they can still give. Some family and friends have handed me checks or cash. Once again my heart is touched by the goodness of people. Just under $20000 has been given of the $25000 expense of the procedure. Thanks. Anything is appreciated.+ Read MoreUpdate 21 Posted by Walt Parks 15 months ago Share On this day of giving thanks I wish to express my thanks to each of you for your gift and encouragement.

       " \"Update 12 Posted by Natasha Pilgrim 22 months ago Share Hello everyone!Brian is still cancer free and doing very well. He is fighting an abdominal infection but this is common in this type of situation. It will take some time for his immune system to get back to normal after all the treatments he endured over the past year.Each day he gains a bit more strength and energy than the last. He is doing a little more each day and beginning to enjoy the nice spring days outside. He is working on getting his Harley Davidson tuned up and ready for summer rides. His hair is growing back and he has even had a haircut and a few shaves! The attached picture is of Brian and his hairdresser Diane during his first post-treatment haircut a couple of months ago. Thank you Diane!As always thank you all for your unwavering support of Brian and his family. We appreciate each and every one of you who has shown your love over the past year. Thank you for keeping us smiling and positive through the tough times. Now that Brian is on his way to a full recovery we hope to be able to do the same for you all in your time of need. Thank youBrian Jean & Natasha Brian's first post-treatment haircut+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Natasha Pilgrim 27 months ago Share 11 We have some wonderful news to share with you all! Brian is in complete remission!Brian and his family met with his oncologist in Rochester on Tuesday. Brian's PET scan showed that the stem cell transplant was successful. Brian will be completing three weeks of radiation in Eau Claire. He will not be admitted for this proceedure. We asked the oncologist why this was necessary if Brian is in complete remission. He told us that lymphoma is notorious for coming back after remission. The doctor believes that radiation could stop this from happening. He believes that radiation could cure Brian. Brian will be home unless misbehaves and ends up in the emergency room (again... ). His immune system will take about a year to recover so please only visit when you are not ill. Thank you to everyone who has wished us well. You will never understand how much your support has meant to us. We are forever greatful. Thank you Brian Jean & Natasha + Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Natasha Pilgrim 28 months ago Share Good news everybody!Brian and Jean have made it home from Rochester. They have been home for a couple of days and Brian is getting stronger each day. Of course he had to push his limits the other day and ended up in the emergency room. He decided that he was going to help with chores outside and ended up having an allergic reaction to something. He is now home and doing better but Jean has her hands full keeping him out of trouble. Brian will return to Rochester in December to complete a PET scan and to discuss completing radiation therapy. The PET scan will show if the stem cell transplant was successful in removing the cancer. If he completes radiation therapy it will take place in Rochester. The machines there are more sophisticated and will be able to target individual cancer cells that we are not able to detect in the PET scan. For now Brian is home resting and healing from the effects of the transplant. His immune system is very weak so if anyone would like to visit please come when you are not sick. He is very weak and tired so please call ahead and see if he is up for a visit. Thank you to everyone who helped out while Brian and Jean were away. We would not have been able to do this without everyone's help with the animals and the house. We appreciate everyone who helped us over the last few months. Thank youBrian Jean & Natasha + Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Natasha Pilgrim 28 months ago Share 11 Brian has completed the stem cell transplant and is now resting and healing. The chemotherapy was very strong and has decreased his blood counts and his immunity. He is now fighting an infection in his abdomen. This is typical for stem cell transplant patients. Brian has been taking oral and IV antibiotics to fight the infection. He has also been having complications with an irregular heartbeat. Brian previously had a diagnosis of A-Fib and this process has made his heart work much harder than it typically does. This has been managed with IV medications and is improving each day. It will take a few weeks before we can determine if the transplant was successful. In the meantime Brian is weak and tired but in good spirits. If all goes well he will get stronger every day. We owe thanks to everyone who has called and sent cards and gifts to Brian in Rochester. You all have helped to bring a bit of joy to Brian and Jean while they are away.

There is a lot to pray for considering this surgery. First and foremost we hope and pray that there will be no surgical complications just like the first surgery. Second there is still a small possibility that this sacral abnormality that was found on the MRI could not be a tumor which would obviously be great news. If it is a tumor as we expect we pray that Dr. Sweeney is able to safely resect all or most of it just like her first one. Barring any complications he expects her recovery and hospital stay to be shorter than the first surgery. I will update tomorrow night after surgery as soon as we know how everything went.

       " \"Update 1 Posted by Brittany LaBue 13 months ago Share So it's hard to put into words how much you all mean to me. I never would have thought in a million years this would have happened to me I don't think anyone ever does.. the support you have all shown me with just your words makes me emotional....But the generosity you have shown me is unlike anything I would have imagined. I know I have an amazing family who are so supportive in every way but friendship is another thing.. even the people whom I really don't know you are like family... we all are. No matter what I believe that we all can come together for a greater good help each other in times of need at any amount. Every kind word every virtual hug or positive vibe I felt. To say I'm not scared would be a lie and we all know I am incapable of that but I promise I am going to win no matter if it's when I'm done with treatment or when I'm eighty years old... I am a fighter if you don't know me personally just ask anyone close to me. I fight for what I believe is right I fight for the ones I care for and I fight for the ones who can't fight for themselves. I will be starting my chemotherapy on Wednesday and I am scared to death but I am going to be ok. We all have to keep telling ourselves that and eventually we'll make it happen at any cost. Today was my last day at work for a couple months and I cannot say enough times how grateful I am for my Buzz crew. They have done so much for me and worked with me through all of my health issues this past year and a half. My boss Laura is a saint and even though she has a business to run she's saving a spot for me to return. They all show so much compassion and care for me and I love them for it. I always will. The universe works in mysterious ways and because of your support it will be returned to you. Because you deserve it because we all do. Please keep me in your thoughts and whenever you want to reach out do it. For anyone that comes across your mind reach out to them it means so much it only takes a moment but the benefits will last a lifetime... tell each other how much you mean to one another smile to a stranger reach out! You never know what someone is going through on the inside. I want to thank everyone for being there for Mark and I through this crazy time in our lives and I hope it's just a little speed bump in this journey called life. I love you all.

       " \"Update 8 Posted by Britta Langen 5 months ago Share Wow its been two months since I wrote an update. Its been on my list of things to do for a while now but I just couldn’t make myself sit down and do it. I’ve lost count of how many infusions I’ve had now but I think we’re somewhere in the range of 8. This phase of treatment has been so much easier on my body than the first phase even though the infusions have increased to every two weeks. I don't have any of the severe side effects that I did with the first phase just some fatigue and occasional aches and pains. On October 19th I’ll go in for my next scans and I fully expect that they will show I’m cancer free. From there we’ll have to decide if I continue with the infusions for a while or if I’ll be done. Either way I’m feeling really really excited about my progress. Its hard to believe I’ve only been in treatment for 5 months. Yesterday Jeff and I celebrated 6 months of being married. It was also the 6 month anniversary of getting the call from my doctor notifying me that I likely had cancer. The official diagnosis didn’t come until 9 days later but the writing was definitely on the wall. So it was a little bitter sweet yesterday. I’ve struggled recently with accepting the fact that this just is my reality for now and while I’m incredibly grateful for how smoothly my treatment has gone I can’t help but feel sad that this is how our marriage has started out. We’ve been talking recently about re-scheduling our honeymoon which Im really excited about. We’re looking at going over my spring break which will fall right around the end of the clinical trial I’m on. We also want to finally plan a wedding reception but that will take a little more thought and planning to pull off. Both of these things I’m excited about but fear also creeps in when I start thinking about it because there’s always that “what if” that so many cancer survivors experience. Speaking of cancer survivors last month I got to spend a week rock climbing in Estes Park with First Descents a non profit that offers outdoor adventure programs to young adults who have experienced cancer. All week we climbed laughed cried and supported each other. We challenged ourselves physically emotionally mentally and grew incredibly close in a short amount of time. Before leaving for the trip I had been feeling so betrayed by my body not only because of the fact that cancer had been allowed to take root in the first place but because I could no longer push myself through a long run a challenging hike or even a walk at times. My diagnosis also shook up my (false) sense of safety in the world and I needed to regain a sense of control and confidence in my body to do what I need it to do. Throughout the week I found myself looking up at the rocks telling myself there was no way but then there there was. So I climbed. I climbed past my fear of slipping of falling of hurting myself. I also climbed out of the hole of self doubt I had created proving to myself that my body is still strong and can still meet any (reasonable) challenge I set for myself. The week was transformative in so many ways and I left with a renewed confidence in myself and ready to take on another challenge.Last spring shortly before I was diagnosed I went to brunch with some friends from my running group. We were discussing hiking specifically 14ers (mountains higher than 14 thousand feet for all my out of state friends) and I set a goal for myself to hike a few this summer. As summer approached and my body started feeling the effects of treatment that goal went by the wayside as did many other goals I had set for the summer. Returning to work in August was really hard. While I’m grateful I had the time off to recover I didn’t get to do a lot of the things I do for self care and relaxation. Like running hiking camping yoga etc. But as the fall approached I started feeling stronger and coming off the First Descents trip I felt compelled to get out more push myself further and continue to prove to myself that I can still do anything (again within reason) that I set my mind to. First Descents’ motto is “outliving it” and that is what I intended to do. So when my dear friend Laura came to visit last week I asked her if she would hike a 14er with me and she readily agreed to the challenge. We chose an easier one Mt. Bierstadt and drove up the night before. We camped in the parking area at the trailhead and woke really early to join a few other early risers on the trail. We hit the trail with headlamps at 4:30 hiking quietly through the darkness. As we crossed a river and started heading up the side of the mountain we could see below us the bobbing lights of other hikers starting on their way along the trail. We stopped frequently to catch our breath and rest but made our way slowly determined to summit by sunrise. We unfortunately didn’t make it by sunrise but reached the top shortly thereafter proving to myself again that the only thing standing in my way was the excuses I’ve been telling myself. It feels good to be on the road to my old self. I’m not there yet I still have a lot of strength I need to regain but I’m getting back into running trying to go to yoga more often and hiking when I have the time. This weekend Jeff and I are going to celebrate our first 6 months of marriage by heading up to the mountains to visit family and checking out the fall leaves which have just started to turn. I love this time of year in the Rockies and am so grateful that I’m here and healthy enough to enjoy it. On a side note I’m going to keep updating the Gofundme page for those who don’t have Facebook and have been following my journey on the donation page. However Jeff and I feel that we are doing ok financially at this time and don’t expect any more donations. We have enough funds for me to continue with alternative treatments and are still beyond grateful for everyone’s help. Much LoveBritta+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Britta Langen 7 months ago Share Hello Everyone! Jeff and I just returned from a great trip out to CA where we visited with family and friends spent some time out on the coast wandering the beaches breathing the ocean air and searching for perfect sea shells. It was so nice to take a breather from treatment and have a change of scenery. On Monday I jumped right back into things with three appointments including a 3 month follow up CT scan followed by an MRI on Tuesday. This morning we had an appointment with Dr Lewis to review the scan results and get the first infusion for this phase of the study. As you may recall from my last update we had decided to stop the combination infusions and move into the next phase of treatment which consists of just Nivolumab a targeted therapy designed to inhibit the cancer’s ability to hide from my immune system while also still stimulating an immune response. The doctors believe that the two rounds of Ipilimumab that I already had were enough and that my immune system will continue to fight the cancer from here. The Ipilimumab was the one that made me really sick so hopefully going down to just the Nivolumab will be a little easier with hopefully fewer side effects.I wasn’t able to get the infusion as planned today because I had an allergic reaction to the contrast solution used in my CT scan on Monday. My doctor wants to wait until my immune system calms down a little and I will go back in on Friday for the infusion. Apparently its possible to start reacting to to contrast after several scans so they will have to either pre-medicate me next time or do the CT without the contrast.But…. my scan results were REALLY GOOD! Four of the five tumors are “resolved” meaning gone basically including the one in my heart. They found no new growth and also said that the one remaining tumor in my lymph node has shrunk. It was the biggest one so I expected that it might take a little longer to make its grand exit but it will soon enough. The doctors have been very carefully to keep any excitement contained but today one of them told me that my progress has been “remarkable” and “exciting” given the short period of time I've been in treatment. I was hoping for a high five or something but maybe I’ll get that when I’m completely cancer free. Which by the way I strongly believe will happen by my next scan in October. I read somewhere that they won’t declare me cancer free or “no evidence of disease” (NED) until I’ve had two clear scans but I’m going to go ahead and start counting it from the first clear scan which WILL be in October. Next steps: I will start phase two of the immunotherapy treatment on Friday assuming that my allergic reaction has cleared up. I’ll also continue to work with my naturopath and acupuncturist to support my immune system and maybe even start working on healing my thyroid. We are going to also start looking into deficiencies in my body and methylation as it plays an important role in detoxification inflammation immune response genetic expression repair of DNA and so many other important processes in the body. It won’t necessarily tell us why I got cancer to begin with but it can give us some good information for what to do from here to hopefully keep it from coming back. I’m also continuing to work with a Reiki healer every week and a woman who is doing neurofeedback. These things coupled with the standard treatment diet and general self care are the reason why I have responded so well. I just know it. I know I say this every time I write an update but I am so grateful to everyone who has reached out sent books cards text messages visited made donations given me blankets and other supplies for long days at the infusion center. The support I have received from everyone is unlike anything I could have ever imagined. THANK YOU!+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Britta Langen 8 months ago Share Dear Friends and FamilyWe have good news! I had another visit with Dr Lewis at CU yesterday to check in on my progress and discuss next steps. As discussed in my last update my third infusion was cancelled due to my extreme immune response and toxicity levels. While this was initially upsetting I’m grateful that my doctors made that decision because it gave my body time to recover and I am feeling almost 100% myself again. Over the 5 week break from infusions I continued to see my tumors shrink which was really motivating and definitely helped me keep my spirits up. I was really anxious going into the appointment yesterday not knowing what the plan was going to be moving forward and gearing myself upper a potentially difficult conversation with my doctors. We’ve been working hard to find a balance between following the standard treatment protocol and also seeking out other more natural ways to support my body through this and those two approaches are often in conflict with one another. The immunotherapy approach can be very aggressive and because it’s such a new treatment there is no longitudinal data on side effects/long term consequences of this type of treatment. With this in mind and knowing that another infusion would likely make me sick again and do more permanent damage to my body I was really struggling with weighing the cost/benefit and trying (unsuccessfully) to not let fear dictate my decision. Ha! We arrived at 1:30 went to the lab to have my blood drawn and then headed upstairs to meet with Dr. Lewis. He checked my last remaining subcutaneous tumor and couldn’t find it (I can feel it but only when I’m standing up) and seemed pleased with the results. He told us that the results were the best we could have hoped for and spouted off some really promising statistics about response rates and long term effects. He then told us that we could push for another round of infusions watch and wait or move on to the second phase of treatment which involves continuing with just one of the drugs to inhibit the cancers ability to hide while my immune system continues to do what it now knows it needs to do thanks to the treatment. This is an option we didn’t think we would have as we thought that if we chose not to get another combination infusion we would be off the study. Jeff and I both were feeling apprehensive about being off the study because it would mean that we wouldn’t be under the care of Dr. Lewis. If you recall the reason we signed up for this clinical trial was because Dr Lewis is one of the best Melanoma doctors in the country and we wanted to be under his care. So this is a huge relief. I really truly believe my immune system can take it from here and we can continue supporting it naturally and avoid any further potential negative consequences. The drug I will continue with has less side effects and doesn’t tamper with my immune system which is what I’m really trying to avoid as much as possible. So we have to wait until I’m off the steroids completely before we can continue which works out perfectly because we also have to wait until the proper week in the study protocol before they can move me into phase two. Jeff and I will head out to California to see family at the end of this week and I get to have another three weeks of freedom from doctors visits. When we return I will get a scan to get another baseline and see whats going on in my heart and lymph node then we will start the next round. I can’t even begin to explain how happy I am at how fast this has all happened its been just under three months since I was diagnosed and it feels like we are moving right along. We’ve been holding off on some of the naturopathic treatments the last few weeks but we are going to start really focusing on those from here on out now that I won’t be taking any of the immune stimulating immunotherapy drug. While I’m grateful for that drug I’m also grateful to be done with it and moving on to a more natural approach. I feel strongly that its whats best for my body at this point and that everything that we have been doing and will continue to do on the naturopathic side of things is making a huge difference. I’m thankful that we are able to seek out and take advantage of all of the wholistic therapies available and it really is made possible by you. So thank you everyone for your support. This is really REALLY scary stuff and this journey could have looked very different. We aren’t done yet but I feel like we are starting to get close! Love Britta+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Britta Langen 9 months ago Share Well I didn't expect to be giving another update so soon but one thing I'm (slowly and grudgingly) learning to expect from this journey is to let go of all expectations. Didn't Shakespeare have some clever words on expectations? That they are the root of all heartache? So today my infusion was cancelled due to concerns that I'm developing colitis based on my blood work and continuing side effects. My regular doctor was out so we are waiting for confirmation from him but the next step will most likely be a 5 week round of pharmaceutical cocktails including steroids and acid blockers and hopefully my immune system will chill out enough that they can then continue with the treatment. The concern is that while the treatment has done its job in triggering my immune system to fight the cancer my GI and thyroid are also suffering and they don't want those things to get worse or another part of my body to also become a target. So now we just wait and see. The good news in all this is that Dr Medina said that while we wait my immune system will likely continue to work on the cancer and it could be that the treatment has already done what it needs to do. So if the steroids kick in soon enough I might get a few weeks of reprieve and some time to enjoy the beautiful Colorado summers I've grown to love. And of course our trip out to CA that I'm so desperately craving. That's all not grate but also not terrible. I feel like I'm getting oh so good at finding those silver linings :)+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Because of the lymphnode involvement and other factors her chemotherapy will be extensive: 24 weeks of chemotherapy followed by radiation. That's 6 months of chemo and another several weeks of radiation. It was a very sobering appointment to say the least! She must first undergo some tests including a pet scan or alternatives (cat scan & bone scan) and a muga (heart) scan and take care of some major dental work before her treatments. Her chemotherapy is scheduled to begin September 25th. The length of treatment and the side effects that will likely interfere at times with her ability to work make our efforts all the more pressing. Her outlook is very good and she intends to continue to work when she is able and maintain a 'normal' life as much as possible. Your friendship and support have been truly amazing to her and filled her heart with deep felt gratitude.

Here is a picture I\\'d like to share of me and a few friends who wanted to support my hair loss.Summer Haircut+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Bryce Vrana 8 months ago Share Like many others who will be speaking on here I first met Bryce in college. We really didn’t interact much the first time as he was a friend of a friend and we only saw each other at the occasional dinner or party. That would inevitably change to the point where I can safely say Bryce is one of my dearest and closest friends. We didn’t really start hanging out until my senior year and his junior. Like many college boys we bonded over our shared love of…uhm…event planning. The next two years would become a string of themed parties events and shenanigans organized by him his roommate and the occasional me. At each and every event he miraculously balanced host and party-goer: enjoying his own time without pause while somehow also being one of the first memories for each and every person at the party the following day. Whenever these same people had a birthday (usually their 21st ) Bryce would always lead the charge for all of us who were of age to take them out and show them a good time. I literally cannot count the number of people we’ve taken on their 21sts…that teamwork and comradery became such an integral part of our friendship that I would even call him from Japan while he was taking somebody out for their 21st shots; it was that important. Perhaps my favorite experience with him occurred in the summer of 2015. For three months Bryce and I lived a daily schedule of going to the gym for 2-3 hours followed by heading back to his place to drink a few 12 packs of beer and play Diddy Kong Racing for the next 6 + hours…you know only something 21 year-olds can get away with without serious issues. I imagine that now and almost immediately get a headache. Regardless this happened every.single.day. It was glorious. Honestly it wasn’t long before our other friends and girlfriends were curious were we vanished to every day….nowhere…we were playing Diddy Kong and screaming at that damn flying triceratops and ghostly clock! After that Summer I left the US and have been pretty much out of AZ for the last 2 ½ years. While it was definitely difficult going from a daily dose of Bryce to none at all it was definitely helped by the fact that Bryce is not the kind of guy to let friendships fade away. We’ve kept in contact almost weekly and every single time I am back in the US I head back to visit my dear friend. I like that system and I damn well want it to continue. -Jon Rummel+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Bryce Vrana 8 months ago Share 22 I have known Bryce for most of my life. He has always been a true friend to me even when life gets busy. I have always been able to count on him for anything whether that is a night out helping with a move or being the best man at my wedding; he is a rock solid best friend. -Phillip Eason+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Bryce Vrana 8 months ago Share My first conversation with Bryce was a rather awkward one where we tried to make small-talk about the U of A. It didn’t last very long and I don’t remember us saying much beyond “Oh you went to U of A? Cool so did I.\"\" As we spent more time together at our shared workplace I started to come to the conclusion that Bryce was a pretty cool dude. I was reluctant to ask if he wanted to hang out though because (and I really can’t understate this) I am a very awkward human being. Lucky for me though Bryce wasn’t nearly as reluctant. On his invitation I went to a craft beer festival in Prescott with him his girlfriend at the time his friend Tim and a few other people. We all had a blast and I still have my souvenir cup from that day. After the beer fest I started to hang out a fair amount with Bryce and Tim. We realized that we had a lot of similar interests. By that of course I mean that we all loved to drink especially Tin Cup whiskey. In fact one of the very first nights that I hung out with Bryce and went out to the bars we got blasted on whiskey and I attempted to wrestle with him in the parking lot of his apartment complex. I remembered exactly none of that the next day but I had plenty of evidence in the scrapes on elbows and knees. My parents also happened to be in town that weekend and I grabbed lunch with them after I woke up. Once they saw the scrapes and heard the story they coined Bryce’s newest nickname “Whiskey Wrestlin’ Bryce.” We have plenty of other drinking stories but I think I have already digressed too much into degenerate territory for the purposes of this story. Suffice to say Bryce has transformed from an acquaintance to one of my closest friends in just a few months. In fact Bryce (and Tim too) turned out to be a godsend as the summer of 2016 marked a huge milestone for me. I moved to Phoenix from Tucson after completing my Bachelor’s Degree and acquiring my first professional job. However all of my friends were either in Tucson or scattered elsewhere around the country. Between my first professional job and a new city I had been feeling overwhelmed and a tad lonely at the time. However those two especially Bryce brought me back to Earth and helped me get acclimated to Phoenix. Eventually they became a big part of the reason I call Phoenix my home and not just where I live. -Theodore \"\"Scooter\"\" Sumpremo+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Michelle Bussell 37 months ago Share Last Chemo Today!!! Terry has his last chemo treatment today. We are thrilled that he is in remission and we are more than ready to close the door on this chapter of our lives; however the reality is that he needs strength to make it through the nasty side effects he will endure over the next 2 weeks. As I mentioned before each treatment is harder on his body. The side effects from this last treatment were terrible. His body was weakened to the point of an infection from which he has just now recovered. He only has a lingering cough remaining. So we ask for your prayers today and over the next 2 weeks for physical strength and endurance to fight against the side effects. Additionally please pray for rest. Terry takes a high dose of Prednisone for 5 days starting with chemo day. Sleeping is near impossible for those days. It's hard to watch someone who is physically tired not be able to sleep. We plan to try Epsom salt baths this time to see if that makes a difference. Thank you for following along with us on this journey over the past several months! Your encouragement prayers donations delicious meals and well wishes mean the world to us! We are so blessed by you wonderful people! God Bless you all!With much love!Michelle+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Michelle Bussell 37 months ago Share Update: For some reason my full message didn't post last time so let me explain why Terry is still doing chemo when he's in remission. The oncologist gave Terry the option of radiation or 2 more chemo treatments. Terry chose chemo because he had heard some negative things about radiation. Even though we knew going into chemo that each treatment would be worse than the previous one. This last one proved that. The side effects from this last chemo have been pretty rough on Terry. And he's been trying to work everyday since his treatment to process year end payroll forms for all his clients. He's such a hard worker! (Terry I love you my Darling!) His next chemo is February 11th. I'll update you again around that time. Thank you again for all your prayers and good thoughts! We appreciate them! We love you!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Michelle Bussell 38 months ago Share Great news!

Overall he is pleased with how well Terry is handling the chemo. No doubt in my mind that is due to all the prayers!! He has a PET scan next Tuesday to see if the tumors have shrunk. If so he won't need any more chemo and he will start radiation shortly thereafter. If the tumors haven't shrunk then he will need 2 more rounds of chemo which we tentatively scheduled for the next treatment to be on the 20th.

       " \"Update 3 Posted by Suzanne Clark 6 months ago Share Hello Everyone!I am happy to report that my recent brain MRI was clean. There is currently no sign of a reforming tumor. Every 8 weeks I have to go for this test and it makes me very nervous until the results come through. So far so good! I cannot thank everyone enough for all of your love and support. My medical teams in Binghamton and Boston have been wonderful. They are so supportive and informative. I am trying to be a good patient!Currently I am on a 28 day chemo plan where I take 5 days of treatments and I have the remaining 23 days to rest and regenerate my energy. This program has allowed me to get out and a bout a bit more. This summer we had a very nice family trip to the ocean I enjoyed my step daughter's beautiful wedding and I have been able to attend a couple of very nice local community events. That feels so good!My hair is starting to grow back so I am happy about that! I have been going hatless! I do realize I look odd to anyone that does not know me with this 1/2 bob 1/2 brush cut touch of blond and chestnut brown with some grey sparklers hair style... LOL!Regarding my prognosis I am hoping and praying for some very good news from the trials that are going on at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. I was scheduled to get on one of the trials but I became very sick with a virus last spring and was not healthy enough to be included by the start date. That is why I am on this chemo program to try to keep clear of tumors while the trial marches on. Hopefully this trial will be as pioneering in brain cancer as it has been in skin cancer. I have become aware of so many wonderful people living with brain cancer that need their hope of a cure to become a reality. I feel that it is within reach! Dana Farber is an amazing institution where you can't help but believe that you are on the very front line of the cancer fight! That being said I do know the reality of my condition having lived through it with my Mom. I am trying to control what I can through diet and exercise (including physical therapy for balance issues.) Every day is a blessing and should never ever be taken for granted.Today I am excited to head to my home town Buffalo NY to attend a family reunion and visit with family and childhood friends.Thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart for your love support and prayers. I am inspired by you and I will never give up!xoxo Suzanne+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Suzanne Clark 12 months ago Share John and I traveled to Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston MA for a second opinion on my treatment and advice for moving forward in a positive manor regarding my brain cancer. We got the sense that the doctors at this institution are brilliant and on the cutting edge of cancer research. I feel so blessed that they agreed to see me at all. They reviewed all of my records and scans prior to my arrival and after giving me a physical to conclude the status of my current health they left us in the room to consult with each other. It felt like we were on pins & needles for hours although it was actually only about a half hour. I thank God for John. This is tough stuff and he is so there for me.Upon their return they said that they were exceptionally pleased with the work my local surgeon Dr Galyon did removing my tumor. They were not aware that we had such talent in Binghamton NY and would have expected me to be transported somewhere else for this degree of care. They concurred that the current 30 day treatment of radiation and chemotherapy is the right course of action at this junction. The stressful thing for me has been that I read that only 20% of patients respond to this treatment by not regrowing a tumor within 5 years. The good news they shared with me is that in my pathology report they see a strain that is consistent with the patients that do well fighting the cancer cells from metastasizing back into a tumor in a few years time. Certainly no guarantee but some positive news. So hope... HOPE... that is what they gave me.In addition they said that due to the fact that the rest of me is very healthy and I am considerably young for having this kind of disease I am a likely candidate for a trial that would boost my immune system to help my healthy cells attack the cancer cells in my brain.I am very interested in participating in this trial so hopefully it comes through for me. I will need to finish my current treatments and then get to Boston in 2.5 to 3 weeks to get enrolled. Then I will have to go to Dana Farber in Boston once a week for at least 5 weeks to be monitored as to how my body is responding to the super immune drugs. It feels like I will be a part of something that is so much bigger than me and may really help others in the future. I am very motivated by this idea. They said the initial drug trials had good results in skin cancer patients so they need to get going testing it right away in other types of cancers. So here I go... Butterfly Warrior!!!!Thank you so much everyone for all of the amazing love and support you are giving me and my family. My love to all of you. xoxoxo Suzanne+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Suzanne Clark 12 months ago Share Thank you so much for all of your love and support.

The original plan was to change to a new chemo med that I would take every week for 12 weeks (Taxol) but it causes sometimes irreversible neuropathy. I already have neuropathy so they do not want to chance making it worse so they are going to give me Taxatere instead. With this med it is only every three week infusions which actually sounds better to me. Overall changing to Taxatere sounds better with \"\"better\"\" side effects (if that is possible) less infusions and same general outcome. Along with taxatere I will get getting Herceptin (which I will have to have ever 3 weeks for a year) and Perjeta. My tumor was HER 2+ so the Herceptin is a blocker to keep any of that type tumor from growing back. So essentially \"\"chemo\"\" will stop at the end of July but I will keep getting the Herceptin infusions every 3 weeks for the next year. I am a little nervous just because this is a new chemo med and I am not sure what to expect but after what the first med did to me I think I can handle anything!After chemo is complete they estimate surgery will be in beginning to mid August so that is when I would be out for 2-3 weeks to recover.Over all I am feeling good they were right the tiredness got progressively worse and I am truly still tired from the last chemo round and here I am going to get another one this Thursday. I feel good in the mornings but as the day goes on I get tired. I do what I can but I do not push myself and I take breaks often. Even when \"\"breaking\"\" I am doing something just not on my feetI am hopeful that with infusions now being every 3 weeks I can get to a point where life may return to a sense of normalcy before surgery comes. I am still giving it all I got and keeping a positive attitude. I have had a bit of anxiety lately that I cannot explain I do not feel stressed but my heart is doing some weird things. The doc is convinced it is anxiety but then I get mad because I do not feel mentally stressed but yet my body is so it is weird. I do have some anxiety meds but not sure if they are working and of course I will only take them when I am home.My hubby is convinced that it is because my son is leaving for college and moving 2 hours away but I do not think so. 2 hours ain\\'t nothing for meAnyway I am good.

She wrote this for a blog and it will give you a sense of her strong will and fighting nature. What a great read!!! Thank you for your continued support. Jennifer’s Fight Like a Girl Story I am currently fighting my battle against stage 2 breast cancer at age 38. I found a mass on 2/13/16 and had an appointment with my primary physician for a referral on 2/18/16. I had my ultrasound and mammogram on 2/23/16 biopsy 2/24/16 and was diagnosed with cancer on 2/26/16. It has been a whirlwind. I get routine mammograms because breast cancer runs in my family. I lost my mom when she was only 31 to breast cancer.This mass was not visible on my mammogram in July 2015 so you cannot depend solely on mammograms to find this cancer. Ladies you must check and feel. I never knew what I was feeling for but when I felt this mass I knew it was not supposed to be there. This has all happened very quickly. 2/26/16 is the day that my life changed forever with the official diagnosis. I call it my “bump in road.”I am a wife a mother and a grandmother to a beautiful 8-month-old baby girl. I work full-time and go to school full-time and this is not what I had planned for my 2016. I am supposed to graduate from college this year and with God and my family’s help I will. I will be taking chemo over the coming months (2nd round this Thursday!!) then having surgery then radiation.The span of time from my diagnosis to my first chemo treatment was less than two weeks so my docs have moved fast and remain hopeful they can cure this. I have decided not to go the wig route but simply use hats and scarves to accent where my hair once was. I have decided to embrace this time and think of it as a vacation from using shampoo and having to shave my legs. :) I cut 12 inches of my own hair off so I could donate it before I started my first treatment.Cancer did not/will not take my hair. I cut it.Cancer did not/will not decide what surgery I have. I will.Cancer did not/will not break me or my spirit.This bump in the road will not change my path for my life just merely change the time frame a little. God has a plan. He is using me for something and this trial will become part of my testimony. He brought me to this and He will bring me through it.Just wanted to SHARE!Jennifer+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

The nurse that administered her chemo told her that she was very lucky to be healthy enough to handle the type of treatment she was getting. He said some people are not even healthy enough outside of the cancer to even make it through the regimen she has. Thank God for keeping the rest of her body healthy! On August 20th she had her PET scan so the doctors could evaluate how the treatments were working. That day was very nerve wracking but the many prayers could be felt! Mom's scan came back clear! God is so good! Mom said that the person that read the scan was surprised by the results because her cancer was stage 4 and was in multiple spots and in the bone and yet after only three treatments it was gone. He said that if he hadn't seen her scan before he would never have known she had cancer. They were not expecting the scan to be this good. To God be the glory! With that wonderful news the doctor still wanted mom to undergo the rest of her treatment. So she has continued on with the chemo and TODAY Thursday October 9 mom is getting her last chemo and then gets to ring the bell! Words cannot describe how this makes us all feel. With all that said overall mom has done pretty well with the side effects of the chemo. The last couple were harder and she has been pretty tired and weak. She has had some bad chemo brain lately and also says she feels like she has stomach flu on and off all the time. It seems like the more chemo she has had the worse the side effects get. I know that she could really use all of our prayers today with getting this last treatment and in the coming days as she deals with the harder side effects. Thankfully God has protected her from the illnesses that have been going around as the weather changes so we pray that that continues. Also in the days ahead. I have done some reading and it can be really hard for cancer survivors as they deal with some PTSD thoughts of the cancer coming back and the financial effects of everything. Mom's bills have been coming in and even with their insurance they will be responsible for a large amount. We are still trying to do things to help with the financial burden and will leave this fundraiser open for a while. Mom has missed a lot of work through all of this. She did stick it out and has tried to work as much as she can but has probably missed more days then she worked. We are so very thankful for her employer who has been wonderful through this whole thing. They have done a great job working with her and letting her do what she needs to get better without being penalized. We know that this is a rarity and she has been very lucky. Thanks again for all the support you have all given. We pray blessings on all of you!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 315 total shares\",\n",
       " '\"Update 15 Posted by Jean Aschenbrenner 1 month ago Share It\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve posted an update. I had a wonderful time with friends and family this past Thanksgiving and Christmas. I appreciate everyone who reached out to me in prayer with cards and kind words of encouragement. I got out and enjoyed life as much as possible in 2017 and will continue to do so this year - thanks to games tickets concerts and event invitations gifted to me from so many generous people.I am beginning 2018 with some challenges: increased out of pocket medical expenses with prescription and co-pay increases as well as treatment struggles.I was not a candidate for radiation due to having too many lung nodules and their size. This round of chemo has been awful for me - and it takes a lot for me to break down - but I will pick myself up and do it all again soon! I am halfway through this round of chemo; and I have one more left before my oncologist has to remove me from chemo therapy due to debilitating side effects and permanent damage. I am experiencing sensitivity to light and sound ocular migraines and my sense of smell and taste are affected while in treatment. My lung nodules are still present and have not decreased in size - but I am not discouraged! I am still alive and David is taking good care of me. Every struggle challenge and setback is thickening the armor and will only add to my great testamony when I beat this disease!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BwrzMuD91tI+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Jean Aschenbrenner 6 months ago Share Hey friends and family!

I recently received some not-so-favorable news. I have cancer in both lungs - but I feel fine. The lung nodules are very small. I am going to The James Cancer Hospital at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center on August 4th to find out if I am a candidate for an immunotherapy clinical trial. I would like for my body to be able to recognize the cancer and fight it. Y\\'all know me - I never back down from a fight! Thank you all for your unwavering support. I am so grateful for your loving kindness and prayers.To help offset medical expenses my running group - The Heights Running Group - has put on a Half Marathon and 5K on Saturday August 19th to support me.

       " '\"Update 3 Posted by Kelly Exum 42 months ago Share YESSSSS! I have successfully completed a LONG 4 1/2 months of chemotherapy as of Sept. 10th 2014. I thank God for covering me and keeping me in my right mind. When a person goes through chemo it becomes a battle in the mind as well as a physical battle. There were days I didn\\'t see in the natural of how I was gonna make it days I wanted to quit days I couldn\\'t pray for myself days I just cried because I felt alone in a situation you NEVER want to be or feel alone in days I cried because of the pain and suffering I was enduring. Even though I had support that wished they could\\'ve helped there was nothing they could do. From the treatment I had on August 20th until now I\\'ve been experiencing a lot of pain EVERYDAY. The pain is from my feet up my legs thighs hips back to my arms and hands. The past two weeks my feet and ankles would swell EVERYDAY. It\\'s become hard to stand for more than 10 min. straight walk a few feet bend to put my socks and shoes on etc. Its become really hard to function as a parent should/needs to as a store manager needs to etc. I go for a CT Scan on Sept.30th to begin the process of radiation. I\\'m expecting radiation to begin no later than the second week of October. The duration for radiation will be Everyday (Mon-Fri) for 6 weeks.. My oncologist expressed to me that radiation will be exhausting and he wants me to stay at the part time restriction I\\'m currently on at work. :( Not what I wanted to hear but I had a feeling he was going to say that. I know it will take some time for my body to regain strength. I just want this PAIN to go away. I am grateful for this process and the lessons I have learned but I\\'m excited that I\\'M ALMOST DONE!!!! As I may be almost done I know it may take some time for me to fully recover. So I pray that you will continue to support me as I continue my treatments and recovery afterwards to get my strength back. Thank you to all that have donated prayed shared my story and followed my progress as I post. God bless you and again THANK YOU!!! Please don\\'t stop donating!!Last day of chemo! :)+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Kelly Exum 43 months ago Share What a Mighty God we serve!! I am back at work! After sitting home for 2 weeks without pay waiting for my job to let me know if they would accommodate my restrictions just for them to say \"\"no they couldn\\'t accommodate my restrictions\"\". One week later they called and said they can accommodate my restrictions. Just so you know my restrictions are: no lifting and cant work more than 30 hours per week and these restrictions are to be enforced until September 20th. My doctor had these restrictions to be enforced until November 2014 but because my job was saying that was too long... I talked my doctor into shortening the time frame (my job still had a problem with it). When they told me they couldn\\'t accommodate my restrictions I was upset because I worked for them for 13 years and felt like I was being punished for something I couldn\\'t control. I began to talk about what was going on with my job and I got connected with this lady that\\'s affiliated with the American Cancer Society and right after I spoke to her I got a call from that I can return too work with my restrictions. I tell you God is making a way out of what it looked like no way. I\\'m back to work still as a manager but only part time for now so my pay has been cut because of my hours being cut. I\\'ve been back to work for a week now and as happy and thankful as I am I still struggle physically. My legs hurt a lot and more often but as a mom bills have to get paid and caught up along with needing to get prepared to send my two youngest girls (6 & 7 years old) back to school. Most of you don\\'t know but 2 years before being diagnosed with Breast Cancer I was diagnosed with having 3 bulging and herniated discs in my neck which is pressing against all my nerves on both sides of my body and also on my spinal cord which causes pain from my neck down my arms my back all the way to my feet. So going through chemo the pain has become intense at times.So if you\\'ve ever wondered if Miracles really exist you\\'re reading the story of one.\"\" I Am A Walking Miracle\"\" and it\\'s only by the Grace of God!! He\\'s able to do the impossible!! + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Kelly Exum 43 months ago Share I got a call from my job\\'s headquarters today. They said they can\\'t accommodate the restrictions that I mentioned my doctor gave me so I have to go back on a leave of absence and short-term disability until I can return to work at FULL duty. I\\'ve ALREADY waited for them for two weeks to make this decision going without pay the whole time. This is SO frustrating!But now that I know where I stand as far as work is concerned I need your help now more than ever. School starts soon and the little ones will need supplies and other needs before they return plus rent and other bills need to be paid not to mention the money that I already owe.I am so emotional and overwhelmed right now. I can\\'t stop crying. I was afraid to talk about my battle with cancer because I didn\\'t know what the response would be. My heart is overjoyed by the responses I have gotten. The inbox responses I have received have brought tears to my eyes because people really do care and I am so appreciative and blessed to have such people willing to stand in my corner. Thank you to all that have shared my story those that have and are going to donate and those that want to give but don\\'t have to give. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart.

Being told I had breast cancer feels like just yesterday...and now I\\'m finally free!I would like to thank everyone who sent me their strength love and blessings through my journey. I used every bit of it to complete the breast cancer walk this past Saturday. I may have stopped a few times and nearly died from the heat (IT WAS HOT) but I walked across the finish line with my BADASS team!! I LOVE YOUSo now it\\'s time for the big event this Wednesday September 14 at The Cutting Room. I hope to see you there!Get your tickets here:https://www.eventbrite.com/e/carol-galvin-foundation-stands-w-tunnel-to-towers-15-yr-ann-nyfw-show-tickets-27084964859Love always....to the moon and the starsErickaXo+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Jermaine Santiago 18 months ago Share In the last 8 months I\\'ve learned that life is too short to wake up with regrets. So love the people who stick by your side treat you right and forget about those who don’t.I\\'m more than honored I was able to be home and be one of the kickstands Ericka needed in her fight against Cancer (and I thank all you that were there too). Trust me it wasn\\'t easy at times being in her room doing something as simple as watching TV or a movie. The mental hurdles one can put themselves through are endless. I wanted her nowhere but by my side in that moment but more importantly the future. We would laugh at shows we watched but mentally I was a mess. The worst thing is not being able to help someone that is hurting or sick. How do you respond to someone that\\'s cold and hot at the same time? How do you respond to a person who wants to go out and just be normal but can\\'t because their blood counts are too low to be around the public? The answer is you can\\'t. Because nothing you say could change their feelings in that moment.I never thought Ericka would be on the journey that was put in front of her. But you have to believe everything happens for a reason. Maybe it was to bring light to men and woman of all ages that Cancer doesn\\'t discriminate. Maybe it was to bring us closer as a family? Maybe it was to tell us to live life without regrets and never take things for granted. Or maybe simply it was just the luck of the draw.19 days ago Ericka underwent her first batch of surgeries. Bilateral mastectomy with the removal of a few lymph nodes and the placement of tissue expanders. She was discharged and readmitted the same day due to excessive swelling. After being discharged we had 2 emergency room visits and 1 unplanned visit to her plastic surgeon\\'s office. But as the days went on the ER visits became a thing of the past her drains were removed and life itself has gotten easier.Last week Ericka went to see her surgeon. Results from her Pet-Scan breast MRI and pathology from lymph nodes/tissue removed during surgery all show that Ericka is cancer free. The news made everyone weak at the knees. But we know the fight isn\\'t over. It has just begun. Moving forward every step taken is crucial for the Cancer not to return. So next week up we will meet with Dr. Perez to discuss radiation treatment. Something Ericka isn\\'t too keen on doing and it\\'s said with a firm NO. The proposed treatments are days straight for weeks at a time. She feels she has put enough abuse on her body and wants to reclaim it. But we will still meet up to discuss as a family the ups and downs of the treatment. Because what\\'s most important is doing whatever\\'s necessary to keep her here.This weekend Ericka and her new breasts will take part in Susan G Komen Race for the Cure alongside firefighter Rick Galvin of the Carol Galvin Foundation. Every year Rick runs in full gear for his mother Carol Galvin who lost her fight with Cancer when he was just a child.Myself and my family will like to see you by her side. She may not complete the three miles but she is determined to try. Words really cannot express what your support and encouragement have done for her during the last couple of months. And to see you there just may give her the push she needs to finish the race.For those that want to partake in this weekend\\'s race....SORRY FOR SUCH SHORT NOTICE!

On days I would like to just lay in bed and wallow I think of you and get dressed for a walk around the block. Believe it or not something so simple makes the world of a difference to the mind body and soul. Thank you!When I was first diagnosed I was hounded and crippled by thoughts of why me? Thoughts of statistics of lining up friends/family and being diagnosed with cancer haunted my head. But as I was faced with the fight for medical coverage being denied by charities because I was too young to have a mammogram and standing up for the rights of my body when research testing was practically forced upon me because of my triple negative diagnosis...I couldn\\'t see this happening to anyone in my life. I\\'ve actually thanked G-d for putting this on me because it would hurt to see someone I love going through this. And I\\'ve vowed that no woman will ever have to go through this again...Everything has its purpose; nothing is accidental in life.A couple months back I was contacted by Rick Galvin of the Carol Galvin Foundation. Rick started the foundation in honor of his mother who sadly passed away from cancer when he was eleven. Yearly the foundation holds an official New York Fashion Week event but this year they have teamed up with Stephen Siller Tunnels to Towers Foundation. They hope to hold a big gala on top of World Trade Center 1 for the 15 year anniversary of the September 11th attacks.Every year Rick picks a woman to be the face of the foundation and this year he has chosen me. This is my chance to stand in front of audience and let my story be heard. To join the fight in awareness of never being too young and against our horrible health care system.But this is also a full circle moment for me.If anyone knows me from my activism days I would go out to raise awareness/funds for the first responders of the attacks on 9/11. I also raised over $9000 for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in memory of my cousin Tony who was a first responder. We lost Tony to cancer due to his commitment to the American people to stay on site weeks after the attacks to aid in clean up and security.When telling Rick my past he informed me that he\\'s a firefighter and my being chosen was a way for the firefighters to thank me. Instant tears on my end. We never met. We don\\'t know each other\\'s story. That\\'s the universe at work.So here I am. Two more treatments until what I hope and KNOW is the end of my cancer journey and I couldn\\'t feel more blessed. I\\'m going to model in an official NYFW show and let my story be heard in front of an audience. But that\\'s not all.Every year Rick runs in full FDNY gear The Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure 5K. This year I plan to walk (but hopefully run; double mastectomy and reconstruction permitting) alongside him in honor of all the females fighting this fight with me.So this being said I\\'m hoping you will join myself and Rick on Thursday June 23rd at the Manhattan Proper for 3 hour open bar to raise funds for the gala commemorating 9/11. Entertainment will also be provided by FDNY Bagpipes and Drums.I hope to see everyone there so I can give thanks kisses and hugs.And be kind to each other.

       " \"Update 1 Posted by Kenny LeCat 6 months ago Share Hello . I want to thank ever one who has contributed to this campaign . We have reached the target thanks to the incredible generosity of so many. When the idea of this fundraiser was brought to me I reluctantly said yes. In the weeks that followed I almost had it shut down due to the extent of generosity by so many of you. It was very difficult to be on the receiving end of this outpouring of support.My friends advised me to let the fundraiser continue Please know that every last penny will be spent fighting this cancer . I'm using the funds to see a holistic Doctor twice a week for a multitude of treatments at his clinic. I'm also following a very intensive diet  supplement and detox protocol under the supervision of an alternative Doctor. My fight against this cancer is my life mission. Defeat is not an acceptable outcome. My current state of health is way ahead of where the experts had predicted with my cancer growing very slowly. I have also turned the corner on many of the side effects I had suffered due to my conventional treatments. I'm staying with my battle plan and thanks to your generosity I have the funds to finance my personal war on cancer without bankrupting my family.

       " \"Update 17 Posted by Sarah Mas Bourgeois 23 months ago Share 22 The day has finally arrived...CAST OFF DAY! This has been the longest three months of our lives and yet feels like a blink of an eye. But we've survived and are stronger for it. Caroline has completely amazed us with her adaptability perseverance and joy despite a difficult situation. There has not been a single day in the last few months that I haven't found myself literally catching my breath in amazement watching her. She has done things that I thought wouldn't be possible for her including scurrying up 4 steps after me while in her Spica cast this weekend! I'm pretty sure she would have climbed the entire staircase if we'd let her! After a long 12 weeks Caroline is finally cast free. It was quite traumatizing for all of us to have the cast cut off (lots of hysterical crying from C) but she quickly calmed down as soon as I was able to pick her up and cuddle. It was amazing to feel her against me without a cast in the way. She feels so tiny and light! Her scar is longer than we thought (we weren't able to see all of it in the cast) but is healing beautifully and is our reminder of her strength. Her surgeon is very happy with her X-ray results. Her hip is currently firmly in the socket so now we monitor for continued growth and hope that the socket continues to deepen. We received better news than we anticipated and Caroline only has to wear a brace to sleep! No brace during the day/at school and she is able to bear weight on her legs whenever she is comfotable doing so. She'll start physical therapy to help with her range of motion and strength. It will likely still be some time before she relearns how to walk but we know she will be there in no time. Thank you all for your support during this journey! Look at those skinny little legs! + Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Sarah Mas Bourgeois 24 months ago Share We're home! So excited to have our little peanut back home and in her own bed.Caroline came out of anesthesia smoothly. The X-ray with dye contrast indicated that her leg is firmly in her hip socket which is AWESOME! So no additional procedures for the time being at least.Her surgeon was able to put her in her Spica cast just to the knee on both sides rather than to the ankle like she had before. It's so strange to see both of her legs free! She is still locked into a seated position with her hip securely in place but she will now be able to crawl and potentially get up on her feet more easily than she did before...once she realizes that her leg is free that is. So far this afternoon/evening she has tried crawling for a short distance but keeps her left leg in the same position it was when fully in a cast. But it's very promising that she was wanting to crawl so early on.So we wait another five weeks in this cast and then the plan is removal in the pediatric orthopedic clinic (no anesthesia) with follow-up X-ray. We'll determine then whether or not she will be requiring and abduction brace and for how long. Fingers crossed!Just waking up+ Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by Sarah Mas Bourgeois 24 months ago Share The day has finally arrived for Caroline's much awaited cast change!The poor little bug was getting a bit restless since she couldn't eat or drink anything after midnight and her procedure was delayed (isn't that aways the case).Caroline is safely in the hands of her surgeon and the medical team right now. She went under anesthesia well despite some tears. They will be injecting dye into her hip socket and will do an X-ray to ensure that her leg is properly seated in the socket. If there are any issues with how it's seated they will let us know and discuss additional procedures. We are hoping that everything looks good in the X-ray and that she'll be able to re-cast quickly. It's still yet to be seen if she will be recast simlarly (to the ankle on the left and above the knee on the right) or if she might be able to be cast to the knee on each side and give her a bit more mobility. Keep the positive thoughts prayers and good ju-ju coming! You've all been instrumenal in Caroline doing so well so far. Thank you!+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Sarah Mas Bourgeois 24 months ago Share It's been a few weeks since our last update but we've had illness after illness in this house. Such is life with a 17 month old in daycare.We've finally reached 6 weeks with Caroline in her Spica cast but we had to cancel after she developed a 103 degree fever and getting diagnosed with RSV Tuesday. But she can't very well go under anesthesia with a fever and difficulty breathing. Her fever has broken and we're hoping to reschedule for early next week. Caroline isn't letting being sick repeatedly perpetual coughing and spending nearly two months in a cast get her down. Within the last few days she is trying to stand up in her cast and today even started letting go of the objects she is steadying herself with. Crazy little daredevil! We are hoping for a positive cast change experience next week good health and a quick 4-6 weeks in this next cast before we move on to this next step in Caroline's journey.

       " '\"Update 26 Posted by Kate Baumgartner 17 days ago Share Today Cary received his 37th immunotherapy treatment. The updates have been less frequent and I apologize but as many of you know I’ve had a lot on my plate. I now tend to only make time to share when there is truly something new to say or celebrate. Nineteen months ago we started on this journey of immunotherapy treatments in Hong Kong to give Cary a better chance at life a prolonged chance of survival we were told if he was a complete responder. Alternatively we were told he would only have 6-9 months to live if we chose to do nothing. Here we are today in Dallas Texas. Our life together continues with visits to the cancer facility every three weeks scans for his whole body as well as a brain mri every three months and followup visits to specialists for symptoms that have arisen from various side effects.Many people don’t survive this awful type of cancer. Their bodies can’t tolerate the immense side effects from the drugs or sadly the cancer just doesn’t respond to the new drugs in this case immunotherapy. Cary continues the fight his fight. Last Monday he was scheduled for his CT scan a scan that must be done every three months to keep watch on this nasty cancer they call Malignant melanoma. A cancer that cannot be cured. It’s sneaky always lurking and waiting for the opportunity to strike out in one’s body and wreak havoc. Cary’s oncologist and also a melanoma specialist said this morning that the results were in and the recent scans were completely clear. You could visibly see the relief and a sense of calm come over Cary. Three more months of being clear no evidence of the disease. We experience this anxiety every three months. Not knowing if this is the day the cancer returns. People tell us to celebrate and we do but not in a way that celebrations are defined. We are just thankful to be given this life and this extra time. Cary continues to have side effects that he has learned to deal with many of which can be mitigated with daily medicine others like the severe pain are minimized but not removed with over the counter pharmaceuticals. He doesn’t want a stronger pain killer that would wipe him out so he sticks with over the counter and has continued pain. He remains strong. He has told me that his good days now are what his bad days used to be before cancer. This breaks my heart. He is not the same. Cancer has changed him. Cancer has changed us. I’m sure many of you agree that have also been affected by cancer that it changes you. All people fighting cancer as well as those around them are changed physically and/or psychologically. The cancer doesn’t decide how we will be affected. We do. We make the decisions that will change the course of our life. We had a lovely conversation today with the oncologist about where Cary is headed if he continues to respond to the cancer treatment and show no evidence of disease. His doctor mentioned that there is no evidence that suggests that stopping the treatment would result in cancer progression in complete responders like Cary. On the other hand staying on the treatment for a prolonged amount of time may result in adverse side effects becoming severe. The drugs are relatively new in the medical field and there is still no long term data as well as very few long term survivors. We are hoping that Cary could possibly stop treatments if he continues to show no evidence of disease possibly as early as July of 2018. This would be the two year mark since being diagnosed with stage iv cancer. Stopping the treatment may help him to have a lessened amount of pain on a day to day basis. Again it’s one day at a time. Cary is thriving at work and loves his job. His clients admire his years of aviation experience and are truly appreciative. I think it is incredibly amazing how far he has come and the amount he has accomplished in the last twenty months since being diagnosed with stage iv terminal cancer. Life can go on if you continue to fight each and every day and he is showing us how gracefully. Thank you again for all of your letters phone calls love and support. Thank you for riding this rollercoaster ride of life with us. Love Kate & Cary+ Read MoreUpdate 25 Posted by Kate Baumgartner 4 months ago Share Here we are in Dallas Texas and Cary is receiving treatment his 31st immunotherapy treatment of Opdivo in the last 15 months. Sitting in this huge “cancer dedicated” facility is daunting. So many people suffering with this awful beast that has varied names. We see the same people over and over again others only once. Some suffer alone while other patients have the support of family. The last couple of weeks have been very draining and wrought with pain for Cary. He’s had severe fatigue and pain in his knees and ankles that would probably measure 8 out of 10 on a pain scale with 10 being the worst. There isn’t anything different causing the pain it just is a constant. Every patient has different symptoms. Some more severe than others. His appearance is still fantastic and if you didn’t know what we know you’d never know he has stage iv cancer. Throughout this time he has worked a full schedule and continued to show grace and a motivating attitude that is truly remarkable. He can’t give up and won’t give up. The options are only to persevere and push forward to live life. Since I haven’t updated you all for quite awhile I’ll do so now. In the last five months Cary has had numerous treatments every other week and has had two sets of scans to determine whether or not the cancer has returned. It has not. Cary remains NED no evidence of disease in his body. Next scans will be in late November probably after the thanksgiving holiday where they will do another Brain MRI and complete PETSCAN. We moved from Hong Kong to Dallas Texas. Cary commenced working for a company as a Simulator training instructor and is working full time. We organized the global move and to this day are still awaiting our container from Hong Kong. We also purchased a car for Cary to get to and from work. I have closed my business in Hong Kong and have discontinued my photography business. Life has been full and busy these past few months and to say it’s been a smooth transition is to lie but we remain positive. Some of you have asked how the treatment compares here in the US to what Cary received in Hong Kong. To be completely honest Cary’s treatment in Hong Kong was amazing. The standard of care was fantastic. Here in the US Cary is being managed by a specialized Melanoma Oncologist whom he sees every two weeks before treatment. He is very pleasant and really listens to the needs of his patient and tries to resolve any pain issues or other side effects. Having a dedicated person who specializes in the type of cancer that Cary has just means that they are more likely to be aware of changes in treatment protocols side effects etc. I continue to support Cary by driving him to weekly appointments and assisting in most tasks just to take some of the burden off of him. We miss our beautiful life in Hong Kong Cathay Dragon Airlines as well as our friends near and far. Wishing you all healthy happy lives. We couldn’t have made it this far without your outstretched arms and love. Thank you. Love Kate and CaryTreatment #31+ Read MoreUpdate 24 Posted by Kate Baumgartner 7 months ago Share Where has the last year gone? Thirteen months since Cary was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and our future unknown. Today we sit in the Oncologists office here in Hong Kong so that Cary may receive his 25th immunotherapy treatment. Simply amazing. When I think about every single treatment all twenty five that we have endured as a couple every two weeks for the last year to get here has been amazing. We are so happy to have made it this far when the initial reports were not too encouraging in the early days of his diagnosis. Over the last year Cary has had minimal side effects except for a recent heart issue this past week and a few long days stay in the hospital that was potentially attributed to the immunotherapy treatments. Through it all Cary has kept an amazing attitude when the wind in our sails has been taken out repeatedly. Many of you have commented on Cary\\'s overall appearance saying that he looks fantastic. And I cannot agree more. He is doing his best to live and cherish this life we have been given. When it rains it pours!!! We have been through so much over the last year. The stress and emotional roller coaster has been unbelievable and I wish it on no one. Cary and I love Hong Kong and all of the friends we have had the privilege to meet over the many years here as expats as well as when we lived in Sri Lanka. Cary has tried repeatedly to secure employment here once he was considered clear of cancer but it was not in the cards. The employers could not see further down the road for a future here like we had wanted. And so it began. Cary recently began looking in the US for a job after being disappointed here. We are thrilled that Cary has been given an opportunity to start a new career and we look forward to a bright future. Unfortunately he must leave quickly to begin his new job. So off we go. On Monday we will fly to the US for our new start and new chapter and I will help him get settled into a new life. Many things to do and prepare in the coming weeks. All a bit too much really in the short term but finally we have something positive to look forward to. I will also shutter my business here in Hong Kong after nine years and will miss my many fantastic clients. It really breaks my heart because my work was a labour of love and dedication that i built. New things on the horizon and hopefully I can recreate myself with a new career just as Cary has had to do. We will miss you all and you will forever have a special place in our hearts. Finding a new Oncologist and Cardiologist are going to be first on the list so that Cary can continue his treatment and remain healthy. The treatments must continue because as we have mentioned before there is no long term data on what will work for each individual nor how long to continue treatments once a person is showing no signs of any cancer as Cary has shown for the last eight months now. According to the calendar we are hoping Cary will have another treatment mid August and then towards the end of August he will have another scan to determine if he remains clear of cancer. All of this is up in the air until we find the right oncologist and proceed with a new treatment plan. Big hugs to y\\'all that have helped us through the last thirteen months of our lives. When one or two doors close another opens. Thank you for opening your hearts to us. Our doors will always be open to you. Without a doubt we couldn\\'t have made it this far without your support. You\\'ve made it easier for us to get through this challenging time in our lives and have helped Cary immensely with his treatment costs. Texas here we come. Love Kate & CaryOn our way to treatment #25+ Read MoreUpdate 23 Posted by Kate Baumgartner 9 months ago Share I do apologize for not updating you all recently. The information we were waiting for came two weeks ago May 12th. We were sweating not knowing what the Oncologist would tell us. Once we were allowed to enter into her office for our appointment the Oncologist told Cary that there was nothing wrong with him he continued to have a beautiful brain and a lovable body. She really did say that. Crazy!!! Cary said “thank you\"\" in his humble way. It was the news we wanted.Now according to the records Cary has been NED no evidence of disease for five continuous months. According to the scans there is no evidence or activity in his cells or organs of cancer.Cary retired from Dragonair after 11 years of service a forced retirement from a company that he loved and a career that he adored. His 35 amazing years as a commercial pilot flying around the world was remarkable and amazing. Now we wait for the next chapter to unfold an unknown chapter at this point. We headed home and tried to digest our day the retirement and the news that all cancer patients should be afforded. It\\'s one we might not forget for a long time.The next treatment was today May 23 2017.This time last year we were packing our bags for our annual repatriation Cary worked what would have been his second to last day of work (little did we know at the time). Eleven months and 22 immunotherapy treatments where has it gone? As we sit here in the hospital awaiting the arrival of Cary\\'s Oncologist we know that the more we know the less we know. How in the world are we going to be able to afford this treatment because right now we are hemorrhaging cash? Cary\\'s quote for the day \"\"That which doesn\\'t kill you makes you poorer.\"\" He always cracks me up. It is a little bit of light humor to get us through another day.Cary has had less overall severe pain as of late than he has had in the past. Overall the Oncologist is genuinely concerned about how we will pay now that Cary no longer has insurance or an employer and the fact that he now has a pre-existing condition dictates that he won\\'t be insured anywhere. This is a problem for most of her patients receiving immunotherapy treatments.We are hoping we will be in her office sometime in June for Cary\\'s 23rd treatment as opposed to the hospital. We have come to an arrangement where she will give us about a 10% discount from what we are paying out of pocket here in hospital if we go to her office for treatment. The final bill amount remains to be a mystery until we actually follow through with it and see what we will be charged. The benefits are that we will be able to get the treatment done in an hour instead of the better part of a whole day in the hospital and of course the potential discounted amount.The reality is that over the last eleven months we have been relatively sheltered from the myriads of other patients in Hong Kong receiving various cancer treatments - Patients dealing with emotion physical changes and mental changes. We just don\\'t see the patients afflicted with cancer like you would if you were visiting an oncology department for treatments. Yes occasionally we see cancer patients and their caregivers in the Oncologist office or in the Radiology department being prepared for their scans but overall we have not been exposed to that side of cancer. The various drab rooms filled with patients receiving chemo radiation or infusions those patients whose appearances have changed or are looking different has not been part of our protocol. Cary has been receiving treatments in an outpatient ward every two weeks and has been somewhat sheltered from this side of the awful disease.I feel like if we had or will at some point we would offer words of encouragement and support. It is so important to do this because you just have no idea what people are going through or how they are feeling unless you reach out. People you see everyday walking or on the train behind the counter as a customer service agent you just don’t know what each person is dealing with. It could be that they are having a difficult relationship dealing with a sick relative or they themselves have been diagnosed with the dreadful life-changing disease of cancer. We all need support. We should all live one day at a time and appreciate those around us. We do and we can thank this disease melanoma for bringing us back to reality to see that life today is more important than what might or should or could happen in the future.Cary and I discussed approaching the Cancer Fund organization here in Hong Kong to see if I could photograph families who are going through similar situations and possibly doing this once a month. Photos are so important to me and I hope you cherish the ones we share with you. It would be a way of giving back to a community that has embraced us for the last eleven years here in Hong Kong. Thank you for your continued ability to surround us with love support and the occasional much-needed hug when we need it.Tomorrow is cause for celebration. Cary\\'s 54th birthday. A celebration another day that we thought might not happen just eleven months ago.Love you allKate & Cary+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 1 Posted by Bobby Lerner 34 months ago Share 11 Two things have happened in our family\\'s lives these past four weeks:1- The heartbreaking loss of our Mother our friend and our Father\\'s lifelong companion.2- The victorious win of Mom\\'s entry into God\\'s Kingdom and the end of her suffering to the illness that plagued her.Mother passed away April 11 2015 with her husband her sister Mary and her children and their families at her side. This was a difficult transition with a memorable ending. Here is the story of these final moments:Mother had dreams of seeing the edge of the land that meets the water... the tropical ocean. As we surrounded the bedside I laid my phone down next to Mom\\'s pillow with the sounds of ocean waves crashing and birds singing. As we held Mom\\'s hands and stroked her beautiful blonde hair I took her on a walk to the beach that she\\'d always dreamed of seeing. It was our final family outing. As the waves crashed we walked onto the beach and I described the texture and color of the sand the height of the palm trees and the scent of the breeze that blew through them. We walked along the sand for a while and I pointed out the flock of pelicans that flew overhead and the sand crabs that scurried about the surf beneath our feet. We stopped here and there to close our eyes and experience the scents and sounds that this paradise was offering. We heard sea gulls flying above the waters edge. Mother\\'s breathing began to relax and grew more shallow. We walked over to the rocks and sat for a spell and then we strolled to the waters edge and dipped our toes in the warm tropical ocean. I described every color and texture leaving no detail unsaid. Mom\\'s dream was fulfilled.It was during this time that Mom took her final breath. A bittersweet ending to a long hard journey.

I finally feel that I am strong enough to share my news (with a little help from a dear friend Danielle)...Without the support and love from my amazing friends/family/work-family I would never have survived the news that I have invasive breast cancer. Stage 1. Apparently that\\'s a \\'good\\' sign- I\\'m sorry but nothing about cancer is \\'good.\\' I went from being scared sh*?#?less? to feeling numb and now hopeful: Hoping to get this f#€%ing cancer out of me!! I still need to wait for my genetic testing to come back to make my final decision for which surgery on 8/21. Unfortunately I have a strong family history of breast cancer on my mother\\'s side- but MORE importantly I have my mother: A 27 YEAR SURVIVOR- and for all those who know her a firecracker! I am also grateful to have my maternal aunt who has survived many years! The cost of this is way beyond cancer...genetic testing IVF egg retrieval embryo harvesting and so on and so on....and most of this is not even covered by my insurance!! However I would never think to ask for help- but my friend has the biggest heart of gold and wanted to help me! It was the sweetest gesture! So I am asking for your patience as I pass through the gamut of emotions. And I am relishing in the incredible generosity in the abundance of love in the supportive advice from survivors and all of the hugs and the \"\"WE\\'VE got this girl!\"\" I am struggling but I know that I will kick cancer\\'s A$$. Then Tim and I can have the family and life we\\'ve always wanted- without the \\'C\\' word!!! This is personal and this is real- I never would have thought about posting this on fb but this is my life. And I will survive.

       " \"Update 10 Posted by Riley Bare 5 months ago Share UPDATE: Emma has had her final tests before transplant. If all of her numbers and test results look good then the transplant process will begin this week. The process includes a grueling round of chemo followed by a day of rest and then they will transplant Jim’s bone marrow. After that we wait until she engrafts. Hopefully we’ll only have to wait a few weeks before her body accepts it and starts making her own cells with his DNA. After that happens and her blood count comes back up they will release her from the hospital. From there we count the days. Somewhere around day 150 they start looking at transitioning her home but she will have to wait a full year after transplant before she can go out into crowds or be around children because she has to receive all new inoculations and that will take several months. Thank you so much for your continued prayers and support. We could not have done this without all of you and we are so so grateful for everything that the community and our friends and family have done for us. Please help us pray that she engrafts quickly. Until the next update.... #LeukemiaPickedTheWrongWarriorPrincessOur beautiful Warrior Princess+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Riley Bare 6 months ago Share UPDATE: Emma is halfway through her second round of chemo and feeling pretty strong. Once she recovers from this round she’ll receive a heavy dose of chemo to completely wipe out her cells and then she will receive her transplant. Once she receives her transplant she will be in isolation until it engrafts. This could take anywhere from 1 to 4 months and it’s extremely hard on the body. We are so grateful to everyone for the cards of encouragement and participation in the many fundraisers going on for Emma. We will never be able to thank everyone personally but please know we are all so grateful and overwhelmed with your generosity and kindness. We are still waiting to find out if we have a donor so thank you to everybody who signed up on bethematch.com that is an unbelievable gift.

Right now they are just waiting for her next bone marrow biopsy to see if she is in remission. Once she is in remission they can get her ready for the bone marrow transplant. Emma has surgery on Monday where they are going to send chemo up her spine put a central port in her chest remove the PICC line in her arm and do the bone marrow biopsy. We will know more after that and will keep everyone posted. Please pray for a speedy surgery continued strength and for remission!!!!Until the next update.... #LeukemiaPickedTheWrongWarriorPrincess+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Riley Bare 7 months ago Share UPDATE: Emma is still struggling with the stomach infection but it is getting a little bit better. She had another blood transfusion today to try to keep her numbers up. Being the tough person she is she is feeling pretty good. Please continue to pray for healing strength and energy for Emma Eddie and the rest of the families. The family would also like to send a message out to all of you generous souls who have offered to donate bone marrow for Emma…..The only way is to go through www.bethematch.com. They will send you a kit in the mail you swab your check and send it back to them. You’ll go into a computer database that will be searching for a match for Emma. But once you are in the databank you may be called on down the road for somebody else with leukemia. There’s no real way to donate only in Emma’s name. The computer only searches for markers that will match her DNA. The family is so grateful to everyone who has offered to be tested.

Positive thoughts are appreciated as he grinds through the next five weeks. + Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Bess DiNorcia 49 months ago Share When we started Chad vs. Leukemia it was because a handful of people had contacted me in the days following his diagnosis wanting to know how they could help. I think I set the original fundraising goal at $5000. never dreamed that this community would be so generous and that we would be only $1250 short of our newest goal of $40K just 7 weeks after his diagnosis. I think his amazing response to the initial round of treatment is due in part to his youth and fitness and in large part to his stubbornness - but the fact that his spirits were kept high knowing there were so many people out there pulling for him has made a huge difference. He still has a long way to go but he has made an incredible start. Whether you contributed $5 or $5000 you have made an important contribution to Chad's recovery. Thank you!!!+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Bess DiNorcia 49 months ago Share Great news: Chad has responded well to the first phase of treatment and the doctors have let him go home for a few days to recuperate before starting the next round of treatment.

I hope you like it.The Testimony+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Pamela Johnson 5 months ago Share Update: This week I went to see the neurosurgeon. We\\'ve been discussing another spine surgery for several months now. He pushed it back so he could \"\"watch\"\" it. The initial surgery removed several top vertebrae and caused my spine to curve. The curvature could impede my ability to walk normally.Dr. Âhmad is pleased with my progress in reclaiming my walking. The curvature in my spine from the surgery has remained unchanged. Had it worsened he\\'d be concerned. Since my walking continues to improve he sees NO NEED for that surgery we\\'ve been discussing for months.He\\'s ordering another set of MRIs to examine the entire spine. That\\'s basically 3 scans. Since I\\'m intensely claustrophobic they\\'ll admit me so I can be completely sedated. The challenged area is the part of the spine that controls my hands which are always on fire in terrible pain and I have tremendous limitations. By limitations I mean that I struggle using utensils writing holding a pen carrying things and my fingers are always swollen which means that they don\\'t really bend. So I\\'m excited about this news! I was dreading surgery. I was in the hospital 6 weeks after the first one and he said that this one would be even worse than that one. Presently I only use that walker when I must walk a whole lot. Otherwise it lives in the trunk of my car. Did you get that? I\\'m driving!We are still touching and agreeing for the manifestation of total healing and the annihilation of cancer everywhere in my body.

She's very grateful to learn that her first surgery will most likely not take place until she turns 15 or 16. Until then her doctors continue to keep a close watch on her. Her little spirit and smile lights up the world and we love her so so much! She continues to help and inspire others with her love of life!

Her pathology tests from her lymph nodes that they took during her mastectomy came back cancer free! Yay! She had her drain removed at the end of last week and gearing up for Christmas break. Last night she rode on the Polar Express with the Mascot Miracles Foundation. What an amazing organization.

We are eternally grateful for all of the incredible medical professionals who have and will continue to be involved in Chrissy's care. Without their expertise and kindness we would not be taking her home today. And without the countless prayers support and love from family friends and angels from all over the world we would not have the strength to go through this. Our hearts are truly filled and overflowing. Thank you!!! + Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Melissa Papaj 27 months ago Share 88 Today was Chrissy's big day. She's a fighter! She went in for her mastectomy at Huntsman Cancer Institute and is doing quite well all things considered. What a blessing that it is literally in our back yard and people travel all over the world to go there. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of the generous people that have donated and offered prayers and support. I felt so much gratitude in the Turner's hearts today for the outpouring of love and support for their beautiful little girl while waiting for Chrissy's surgery. I'd love nothing more than to reach our goal of $100000 even more to exceed it so the fees could be covered too. I'm asking you all to share this with everyone you know and thank you all again for your support. Much love Melissa ? + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

He is battling leukemia like a prize fighter and winning -- and we give all the glory to God and thanks to everyone who has prayed!We had the privilege of spending the day with the Turners on Sunday and Mike is remarkable. From his perspective to his optimism to his faith to his gratitude he is a walking ray of light that reminds me of what courage and Godliness look like.Want to join me in helping him celebrate another trip around the sun? Let's share this page until we reach our goal of $10000. Mike is still undergoing treatment and hasn't been able to return to work full time yet so any prayer and every gift will bless them!Thank you and HAPPY BIRTHDAY MIKE!+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Sandy Broome 35 months ago Share Mike begins week 3 of his local chemotherapy tomorrow and has been doing really well over all. As has consistently been the case when I've checked on him his optimism is incredible and his faith is undaunted.Please pray for some swelling he's been experiencing as well as some blood pressure and heart rate issues. These annoyances require a little extra precaution as they monitor him but he never complains!As always the Turners want to thank every person who has contributed and to all who are praying. We are his extended team and he needs our support! Please consider sharing this page and possibly contributing to the fund if you're able. Every dollar donated helps defray the cost of expenses related to his fight against leukemia.Finally thank you from me too! This is a truly deserving family and I feel honored to call them my friends.+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Sandy Broome 36 months ago Share Mike will be getting a portacath today as well as receiving orders for his next 90 day treatment plan--which means he will be able to stay home during this next phase of therapy! This will be a huge blessing to the familyIn every step of this difficult journey Mike and Sandra have steadfastly trusted God and have seen His faithful provision-- from the doctors who first diagnosed the cancer to the exceptional care in Winston Salem to the compassion of friends family and even strangers who have reached out to help they want everyone to know that they are doing great and are as determined as ever to fight this battle with faith and confidence that healing is just around the corner! Please continue to share this page so that anyone who hasn't yet heard may be inspired to bless them as they face the future with courage and trust in the One who has carried them this far-- and will carry them in the days ahead. God has shown the Turner family glimpses of His love through the generosity of many--let's keep the love and prayers flowing!+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Sandy Broome 36 months ago Share Friends of Mike and Sandra--PLEASE read and share this update. We are less than $2500.00 from the goal of $10k and every penny contributed has enabled Sandra to stay by Mike's side in Winston Salem as he courageously fights this insidious cancer. If you've donated to this cause they again want you to know how grateful they are. If you have shared this link thank you!If you've prayed they ask that you pray again-- specifically. Mike's neutrophil (a white blood cell) count it still too low for him to be able to come home. Infection risk is serious for anyone battling leukemia but when this white blood cell is diminished the risk is compounded. Mike reports that he has received exceptional care and he is confident that by faith and with prayer his neutrophil count will increase and he will be back home to his boys and community soon.

       " '\"Update 11 Posted by Joshua Drisko 1 month ago Share Hello everyoneLast week we recieved some unfortunate news. Christina’s cancer has relapsed and there is another 8 x 7 cm mass in the same location. The mass is causing fluid buildup around her right lung just like last year.After consulting with her oncologist at Moffitt our best option involves 2 months of intense chemotherapy (with the possibility of radiation therapy) followed by a stem cell transplant.While there will be costs involved with these treatments the most important gift we can receive at this time is a perfect match for a stem cell donor. If you haven’t already please visit bethematch.org to sign up as a donor. They will send you a kit in the mail which will be used to add you to their database. Even if you are not a match for Christina you could help save someone’s life.Thank you for the continued support each of you have given us. It has and continues to help us immensely.+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Joshua Drisko 5 months ago Share Hello everyoneIn the midst of all the turmoil going on lately I think we all need some good news.Christina has completed her intense chemotherapy cycles and today is her first day of maintenance therapy! On top of that she\\'s busy packing and planning how she will spend her first week back in Tampa next week!!!Do you need more good news well I\\'ve got some for you...On October 21st our parents will be joining us in Tampa for an intimate gathering where Christina and I will commit to each other in marriage for the rest of our lives. I think we\\'ve proven that we will be there for each other in sickness and in health.We will have another ceremony and reception next year at which we hope to include the rest of our family and friends. We both want her to have the energy to enjoy the entire day of events which a wedding normally entails.2017 has been a daunting experience for us but you our friends and family members have been our strongest supporters. Despite cancer hurricanes and distance apart Christina has shown just how strong she is by fighting back with all of us in her corner.Today is just the first day of her maintenance but we are very hopeful for all for the days to come in our life together. Once again you have proved just how strong a simple act of kindness can be.While we both understand that asking for donations at this time is compounding with all of the other campaigns we welcome any and all donations to help with medical bills or medical-related travels (monthly visits and procedures).At the very least we hope you can see that offering support through words actions and prayers truly does have an impact on those in need. We thank each you every day for your continued support.+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Joshua Drisko 7 months ago Share Friends family and all of those in-between I am excited to announce that Christina is officially in remission! While the best news would have her cancer-free this is an immense milestone towards that goal.Throughout this entire process Christina has been poked and prodded driven to and from the hospital weekly and dreaded answering the question \"\"How do you feel?\"\". Despite every day being a new journey she fought through it. She forced herself out of bed (moaning and groaning some days) to face her cancer one on one. She fought and continues to fight because she won\\'t let her cancer get in the way of her life.All of those who helped her along the way are to thank for this. The physical pain and emotional turmoil was eased with the best medicine known to man: compassion and encouragement. From the teams of doctors nurses and hospital staff that put her needs first (there are a few excluded from this list) to those who have helped raise these funds sent messages and made visits when possible we thank each of you.We know that many people don\\'t get to hear the news Christina heard today. It is a truly humbling experience to realize just how lucky we are. But it wasn\\'t all luck. It was a lot of work for Christina and a lot of sacrifices were made but we have made it to this point and are charging forward thanks to your support.Every donation message and prayer has been and will continue to be an inspiration to keep moving forward.If you haven\\'t already be sure send a celebratory shoutout to Christina the strongest woman I know!+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Joshua Drisko 8 months ago Share Christina finished her last day of chemo for Cycle 2!

       " '\"Update 21 Posted by Christina Mejias-Torpie 19 days ago Share 22 On Thursday Morning Feb 16 2018 at 1:15AM surrounded by her loving family Christina Mejias-Torpie left us. She fought all the way to the end. Even in her last hours she fought hard. We all adored her positivity and gritty stubbornness to not let this disease destroy her spirit. Survived by her Husband Kevin G.Torpie and 5 year old son Colin A. Torpie. I (Kevin) will do my best to Honor her warrior spirit and be the loving father she would have wanted me to be to Colin. Her spirit and memory will forever live on. My love and Colin\\'s love for her is eternal. If you are reading this then you know how hard she fought. How much love she had for herself and her family.I want each one of you to know that with each dollar already donated for her Cancer Cure Fund you raised our spirits and gave us hope. At our lowest we had you all to keep us going and knowing you all loved and supported us was enough to believe that life is good and she was deserving of all the good things life had given her. She passed her love for life to our son Colin who is taking the news of his mothers passing like a warrior himself. This will be a process for him and I am committed to see this through hand in hand with him at all times remembering Christina\\'s beautiful smile and amazing attitude. She did not deserve to die like that. No one does. There no words. It comes down to what you believe in the end. What is most important to your soul at the end. Not things and possessions. That all goes out the door in the end. What stays are the memories. The drawings. The cards sent back and forth. The love expressed though kind acts. That is what stays and that is what I want all of you to know is that if Christina could come back and say one thing it would be to remember what is important and to be kind to all beings. We are all one village and we need each other to keep us going in the rough times. I am blessed to have a loving family and loving community. Remember to hug your loved ones. Be there with them. Don\\'t let stupid arguments get in the way of love. Don\\'t let things get in the way of what is important. Family - love - gratitude and presence are what matters.Many of you have expressed interest to support our family with expenses: medical expenses funeral costs child care bills and other needs for Colin and his future. I want to give you all an opportunity to help us one last time with your loving donations. Any support you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Please keep in mind that any donation no matter what amount makes a huge difference. Please continue to support our family by being a friend and by being present in our lives – this is the best gift a person can give. And this picture of Christina is how I want to remember forever. Thank you all.With love and admirationKevin G. Torpie - Colin A. Torpie#WarriortotheendLove+ Read MoreUpdate 20 Posted by Christina Mejias-Torpie 5 months ago Share 22 Happy Sunday It\\'s a beautiful fall day. My favorite time of year. It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve written an update and a lot has happened. I stopped treatment for almost two months and instead of things getting better they got a bit worse. I went to see a doctor at Columbia whom I like very much. After doing scans he suggested that I start a clinical trial. It involves chemo and I was not crazy about that but we are working on getting into different trials that do not involve chemotherapy. Innovative trials. I\\'m still taking my supplements eating clean and vegan and doing anything else I have researched can help. I started the trial on Friday and have been pretty tired since. Even though my body is tired I am not giving up. I know that one way or another I will have my health again. I have the determination to get through this and I have plans for my life that I must see through. As always thank you so much for your support and prayers. XxLove Christina+ Read MoreUpdate 19 Posted by Christina Mejias-Torpie 7 months ago Share Good morning everyone I wanted to write a quick update since things are really changing now. Unfortunately the scan results were not what we hoped for. It showed progression and in the last few weeks I\\'ve noticed changes myself. For the first time since I was diagnosed I\\'m feeling pain. Not from chemotherapy. My current doctor\\'s method is to keep trying different chemotherapy treatments. I can finally say that I am done with trying chemotherapy. I\\'ve given that route all that I have and it has never worked. To date I\\'ve tried four times. Even with supportive supplements and diet it\\'s not enough. One thing is for sure. I am not finished trying to find what will work for me. Not even close. In my gut I know there is something that will do it. I just haven\\'t found it yet. I\\'ve been lucky enough to connect with a remarkable woman who was in my shoes 24 years ago. She recently told me \"\"you have to just keep trying the next thing until something works\"\". That\\'s what she did and she\\'s living proof. Giving up isn\\'t an option for me or my almost five year old son. I haven\\'t exhausted all the possibilities. So I\\'m on to the next thing. If I said it was easy to make a big shift like this or that I didn\\'t have my moments of anxiety over it I\\'d be lying. But I find peace in knowing that I\\'m not alone in this and I have people in my life who share my determination. Having the support of the people that love you when you\\'re making big decisions is gold. As always thank you so much for your support and prayers. XxLove Christina+ Read MoreUpdate 18 Posted by Christina Mejias-Torpie 8 months ago Share It\\'s been so long since I\\'ve written an update. It\\'s hard to believe and it feels like time just flew by. Since the last time I posted an update I\\'ve been maintaining my almost completely vegan diet (all except the occasional salmon) regaining my strength and getting into great shape working out with great friends and enjoying the summer. I\\'ve also taken the time to paint again. The last few months I\\'ve realized that spending time doing what I love is something that I must add into my health routine. I feel my best when I\\'m outside enjoying nature. It really grounds me and I forget about everything. And I\\'m more connected. Our trip to Mexico reminded me of this and then a recent trip up to Woodstock made it very clear to me. The most amazing thing happened while we were walking through the town. Colin picked up a rock and gave it to me. He told me it was for me and although he doesn\\'t read I think he was right. It said \"\"May you be healthy\"\" on it. I have it on my alter at home and I will always be grateful for the message I got in Woodstock. A few weeks ago I applied for a scholarship to attend a weekend seminar given by the author of radical remission. I love the book and I\\'m so excited to go!Today I\\'m in Chicago for my 4th cycle of the new treatment. After this one I will have a scan and we will finally see the result. I also had to have a conversation with my team about how we can cut costs while getting treatment with them. We will run out of the funds by the next trip. I\\'ve been given a few options. I can pack it all into one day as long as I can continue to stay on this treatment. So I\\'d come to Chicago in the morning and leave at night. And honestly I\\'d love that. It\\'s getting harder to leave home. But we really won\\'t be able to make a decision until I have the scan. Cutting out the cost of the hotel stay and some of the vitamin infusions would definitely make a difference. I guess we will have to see...I\\'m still so amazed grateful and forever changed by every kind act. The people around me have done some of the most beautiful things for me and my family. It\\'s like angels just keep falling from the sky. As always thank you so much for your support and prayers. XxLove Christina+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 7 Posted by Lindsay Cannon 15 months ago Share Welp…I had my last chemo treatment today!!! I can’t thank my Mom Ryan Matt Dad Betsy and Aunt Lisa enough for taking me to my appointments not only chemo but follow ups CT scans PET scans bloodwork not to mention all the hospital visits while I was fighting infections the list goes on! I had the MOST amazing group of people at Rush taking care of me the past six months. My awesome oncology nurse Rachel who always went above and beyond to check on me even when she didn’t have to we shared so many laughs together and she is truly an angel!!!! Dr. Venugopal and his PA Jen were also always there when I needed them the team goes beyond just them – the MA’s everyone who helped to schedule my endless appointments etc. Rush has just been absolutely amazing. I have an updated CT scan next Monday then I go to my radiation Dr. in Lisle starting Tuesday to get a simulation done from there he will plot out the plan for my radiation and if all goes according to plan I’ll start radiation December 5th. My Dr. said I’ll have radiation Monday – Friday for 3-4 weeks depending on how my mass reacts. It has shrunk but it’s still quite large so they hope the radiation will really break it down. As long as there is NO cancer activity and the mass isn’t interfering with my major organs like it was when I started then I’ll be all good! After chemo I’m usually knocked out the rest of the day/night but today I’ve been on such a high I’ve been up all day and I’m crashing hard now! Matt took me to a celebratory dinner & now we are in bed with our baby girls about to watch Pet Life – today was a VERY. GOOD. DAY. Thank you for all your continued support and words of encouragement I’m ALMOST done guys! XOXO#WhenLifeGivesLymphoma #MeyersMakeLemonade #RemixToRemission #LastChemo #FuckCancer 11/16/16 LAST Chemo Treatment+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Lindsay Cannon 17 months ago Share 11 It’s been a while since my last update and there’s a reason for that. I had an updated PET and CT scan on September 27th and wanted to wait to see what kind of news I would be sharing. Thankfully it’s the best possible news we could have hoped for!While waiting for my CT I was freezing shaking I was so cold. Then after at my PET scan still freezing but near the end I felt my face and ears turn blood red with heat I knew I had to have a fever. My brother had taken me to my appointments and the poor kid now had to wait for me to stop by my oncology nurses floor to see if she could check my temperature. I started out around 101.3 and topped out at 102.7 degrees and they admitted me. Both the blood from my PICC line and blood samples from both arms came back positive for infection and that sealed by PICC lines fate. They didn’t want to risk leaving it in just in case the infection started there so while I had a mini nervous breakdown a resident came in and pulled the line out of my arm that I had seen IN my heart the day before on an echo-cardiogram. I was just a tad freaked out about the whole thing! I cried my eyes out while my parents watched it didn’t hurt I had just freaked myself out so bad that crying was all I could do. This past Monday they inserted a brand new PICC line for me to finish out my treatment.My stay at Rush lasted from Tuesday September 27th to Monday October 3rd it felt a lot longer! BUT my amazing view and even more amazing family and friends that came to spend time with me made the stay much more bearable. My girlfriend Michelle from Kappa works at Rush and came by to spend time with me during the week which was SO nice of her! My cousin Heather and I laughed our asses off followed by my girlfriend Amanda painting our nails together followed by more laughing then Saturday my parents Auntie Irene Uncle Kurt Aunt Lisa and Uncle Randy all came by and you guessed it more laughing. Matt brought dinner in and we spend a night in watching SNL and yes laughing. Lindsay and Pete surprised me Sunday around lunch and then Matt and my brother in law Garrett were back Sunday to keep me company. Of course by my brother Ryan Matt and my parents were back and forth multiple times stuck in traffic (they drew the short straws) I really appreciate everyone who came to see me-it really made the stay so much better! If only they had pug visiting hours because I missed my girls SOOO much! I was extremely anxious to hear about my updated PET and bother every nurse and Dr. that walked through the door. On Saturday morning a physician’s assistant came in and told me while I was half awake that the PET showed negative activity meaning no more cancer activity. My reaction to her was “So you mean like remission??!!!” she smiled and said yes. To say I was thrilled would be an understatement I texted many family and friends right away. But still I hadn’t heard from MY Dr. so in the back of my head kept questioning was this PA correct is she sure am I really in remission-crap-what if I’m not?! I had my chemo on Tuesday and my onc nurse said she couldn’t confirm anything and that my actual Dr. would have to but they were at the Rush Oak Park campus so I’d get a call this week. That call came tonight so I can now confidently tell everyone that I AM IN REMISSION and it’s the best feeling in the world! I will still finish out my last two rounds of chemo (started Round 5 this week so I now only have 3 more actual chemo sessions left which is SO crazy and exciting!). Since my mass was so large I will need radiation and have my first consultation scheduled with the Dr. next Thursday. I know from blogs I’ve read that radiation will be daily but I’ll know for sure and how many weeks I’ll have once I meet the Dr. I honestly don’t know what to say. I am so shocked grateful happy excited-and SO much more it’s difficult to explain my feelings. THANK each and every one of you who has kept me and my family in your thoughts’ and prayers-the love we have felt from everyone throughout this entire process has been so amazing and I truly can’t thank you all enough. My journey isn’t over just yet but this news makes the remainder of my treatment SO much more bearable! Much of what I share on here is upbeat and most of the time I try to be positive but there have been a lot of bad days too side effects that would be TMI and no one would want to hear about days that I wake up crying in pain or just because and Matt is there to comfort me my family has put up with my mood swings and much more but the good outweighs the bad BY FAR because well…..REMISSION people!!!! : )Since I’m a huge nerd I can’t stop putting the word remission with random song lyrics and sayings so I’ll leave you with these gems-if you can think of any more I'm so down to read them please share! -It’s the remix to REMISSION-REMISSION Accomplished -Lymphoma-No Mo!-Fuck you cancer DON’T come back now ya hear!?#WhenLifeGivesLymphoma #MeyersMakeLemonade #RemixToRemission #RemissionAccomplished #FuckCancer You are all my angelsThank you! xoxo+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Lindsay Cannon 19 months ago Share 11 Lot’s has happened since my last update! I had a minor bump or two in the road this past week I had a fever of over 101 and was admitted into Rush the day I was supposed to start my third round of chemo. I was pumped with antibiotics one of which I had a reaction to. Apparently I’m allergic to Vancomycin – I had a reaction they refer to as “Red Mans Syndrome”. It is exactly as it sounds I turned a lovely shade of fire engine red and my arms hands and mouth itched like crazy. I waited in the ER with my Mom and Matt from 9 PM to 2:30 AM we were all so slap happy and delirious it was ridiculous. I’m pretty sure everyone hated us. This “Dr.” walked in and looked to be about 15 years old and no joke resembled a Neil Patrick Harris from his Doogie Howser days (calm down Jason). I had taken a Lorazopam when we arrived at the ER and was “a little” out of it but on top of that this guy was so young and looked SO MUCH like Doogie Howser I couldn’t look at him. We didn’t exactly start of on the right foot either he looked at my Mom and Matt and said he assumed Mom-was my Mom and Matt was my husband. Matt said oh no that’s my wife and I’m her Step Dad and we all burst out laughing. This kid didn’t know what to say and he didn’t get our sense of humor. I waited until 4:30 AM for a bed and since my white blood cells counts were good that day (DAMN THEM) rather than getting to stay in the fancy cancer center I was put in gen pop with all the crazy people that scream all night long. After my lovely night in the hospital my fever subsided I was put on oral antibiotics and Matt busted me out of the joint. Then Friday night I was back in the ER with a suspicious looking PICC line happy Friday to me! I spent the weekend in the hospital and was pumped with bag after bag of antibiotics. I was finally released Sunday night and couldn’t have been happier to be home. My PICC line looks much better now and for now will stay in as long as it doesn’t give me a problem again. I started my third round of chemo on August 4th which means at the end of August I’ll be at my halfway point-which is-SO. FREAKING. EXCITING! In even better news I had an updated PET scan and the results were fantastic! My tumor has shrunk in HALF and the Dr. said even more importantly the actual cancer activity in the PET scan has gone down significantly so he is very confident we are on the right path and will continue with the treatment plan he originally set out for me. Which means I’ll still have 6 rounds of chemo (two chemo sessions within each round) and following that I’ll have radiation therapy on my chest. At some point in August I’ll be meeting with the radiation Dr. to discuss my radiation plan. We really couldn’t have hoped for better news I was really nervous going into the PET scan because of the vastly different diagnosis I was given at Baylor in Dallas vs. Rush in Chicago and it seems like Rush hopefully got it right! We are just praying that the positive progress continues over the next three months and the radiation will totally kill this crap!Onto the fun stuff! This past month we celebrated my little brother Ryan’s graduation from Western Illinois University & the end of his internship at the Palatine Police Department. Ryan will be applying to become a police officer and while it’s definitely a scary time to be an officer we couldn’t be more proud of him. It’s something he has wanted to do since he was literally four years old so to see him grow up and accomplish that dream is so amazing. Love you bud! So as it turns out I’m not a violin prodigy as we had all hoped. I now understand why we learn to play instruments as children because that shit is NOT easy when you’ve grown into a clunky adult especially one that has ‘chemo brain’ which I’ve learned is VERY real! Matt said he loves having a dumb blonde(bald) as a wife I was too opinionated and smart before now I’m just the right amount of ditz! As much as I tried and squeaked my way through Twinkle Twinkle my Mom thought I was amazing by the way I decided that my expensive new hobby was meant for smart people and children and right now I’m neither. I’ll have to settle for listening to YouTube renditions of Wrecking Ball sigh. Onto bigger and better things-like what you ask? Well as of a couple days ago I’ve signed my entire family up for the YMCA! We just can’t get enough of living together so I thought this is a great idea let’s all go workout together too! The boys can lift weights and my Mom and I can be found in ‘Group Fight’ (different from the kind we do at home) and Zumba! This new hobby will help get all of us moving and it’s literally half the cost of those pricey violin lessons plus I already know I can kick ass & love to dance so this is an all-around much better choice. I want to give a little love to the amazing people in my life of course everyone in my immediate extended & in-law families but also to my amazing group of friends I’ve been lucky enough to meet throughout my life. The outpouring of love & support by all of you has been truly amazing but I really just wanted to give a special little shout out to those people that have really gone above and beyond.My high school buds Amanda Stefani Stephanie Amy Lisa Deanna & Leah.My college girls Mitzy Campione Wysocki Ashley Julz Melita & Alexis.My amazing girls I met somewhere in between/after school-Betsy & Ashley.My Texas girls Aja Jessie & Ivy.And my AWESOME JCP work family – there are too many to list but special shout out to Jessica Jason & SarahYou all have no idea how much the THOUGHTFUL cards texts lunches dinners and more mean to me!!!

My hair started falling out like crazy this past week and it was time to shave my head! I’ve been told my multiple people that for a woman losing your hair is one of the hardest parts of this whole thing. I’m not going to lie I cried but I also laughed a lot. It was sad and I was scared but when we were done I felt amazing. I feel empowered and ready more than ever to kick the shit out of this crap. My best friend Betsy her husband Jeff and their son Ben and family pup Lieu helped Matt to shave my head and we had a blast. Matt and Jeff started me out with a Joe Dirt mullet and then left a real nasty rat tail which Jeff braided for me-yes Jeff is awesome. Betsy and Matt then finished the job shaving me completely! We sat in the backyard blasted music laughed cried laughed some more I’m sure the neighbors where like WTF drugs are these people on-and they have a baby!?

       " 'Update 24 Posted by Chris and Amorette Rice 8 months ago Share 24th Update 6-25-17 (last update) A good Sunday to you all. We hope you had a nice weekend. The weather has been beautiful! On Thursday we went to the clinic so they could check CJ\\'s numbers and just as they had expected would happen after those chemo shots at home his numbers are down. They told us that normally the effects from the chemo show up about 7-10 days afterward. So Friday he had a platelet transfusion and tomorrow we have to go back to the clinic so he can have another platelet transfusion and a blood transfusion. That should be a 4 hour day at the very least. We won\\'t know when we have to go back to the clinic or if he\\'ll need anymore transfusions this week until we go in tomorrow. But CJ is SO CLOSE to entering the Interim Maintenance II phase. As I said last week it should be just like how March and April were for him. We called those the \"easy\" months and this should be the same. Then he will be moving into the final phase Maintenance around September 15th if all goes according to plan and he\\'ll be there for about 3 years. At this point we want to focus on the good things that are going to be happening this summer. On Wednesday Make-A-Wish Connecticut is going to deliver the materials for the playset. We are going to have CJ and Seren out of the house for the day and in the afternoon after it\\'s all built we\\'ll bring them back for the big reveal party. We can\\'t wait! This coming weekend we\\'ll be celebrating Chris\\'s birthday and the 4th of July with a bbq/pool party and fireworks. Then July 22nd we are having a joint birthday party for Seren and CJ. CJ missed his birthday in February because he was so sick with a stomach virus on top of everything else. So we\\'ll be having another pool party/bbq with a bounce house 2 pinatas fireworks the new playset a kids\\' trampoline and more. It\\'s also the same day as Chris and my 6th wedding anniversary. Then August 8th we have my birthday and August 19th will be Isabella\\'s baptism where her reception will be at our house for another pool party and bbq for our families. Also dare I say without jinxing it I think we may FINALLY be starting the LONG AWAITED and MUCH NEEDED addition to our house. So we have a lot of good things to celebrate this summer and great times ahead for CJ and for all of us. I think in September we may be having a charity golf game at one of the courses up in Mahopac for CJ. I\\'ll keep you updated as the time gets closer. We would like to thank everyone for their continued thoughts prayers and support because although things should be getting easier for CJ soon he continues to need chemo LPs clinic visits hospital visits and medications. As much as the doctors and we try to plan everything out side effects happen and his numbers go down and cycles get delayed. This is not over yet by a long shot. So thank you. Finally a lot of people have told us that they think of us but don\\'t want to call or text us because they know we are busy. While it is true that we are busy not just with CJ but with the girls too you can text us anytime. If we can respond right away we will. If not we\\'ll respond when we can. I will say that texting is definitely preferable to phone calls because we often don\\'t have the time to answer calls and be on the phone for a while but we\\'d love to hear from you. Also if you want to stay informed about CJ you can \"friend\" me on Facebook. I\\'ll post about CJ and the girls throughout the summer. Have a great summer!+ Read MoreUpdate 23 Posted by Chris and Amorette Rice 8 months ago Share 23rd Update 6-16-17We are one week down one week to go of the heavy chemo cycle. CJ did well this past week. After our 8 hour day last Friday a nurse came to the house Saturday Sunday and Monday to administer CJ\\'s chemo shot in the triceps. His appetite tanked and it was like pulling teeth to get him to drink anything. We tried ice pops lollipops applesauce...anything that might hydrate him but he was hardly eating or drinking at all. I almost brought him to the clinic on Wednesday to have him re-hydrated but then he seemed to drink enough where I felt like he was ok. We took him to the clinic today so they could run his numbers which were good. His ANC was actually higher than last Friday. The nurse and doctor were happy with his numbers for where he is in the treatment cycle. He got his chemo through his port and will receive chemo shots at home for the next three days along with his chemo pill at night. I also asked if they could give him fluids to hydrate him before going into the weekend and they did. All chemos will stop this Thursday for this cycle. Then he has two weeks free of meds (except for Pepcid an anti nausea and an appetite enhancer) before he moves into the \"interim maintenance 2\" phase. It is like March and April which we call the \"easy\" months. He will still be getting chemo and having LPs done but July and August should be fairly good and then in September he\\'ll be moving into the last phase maintenance which he will be in for about 3 years. Next Friday/Saturday will be my last official GoFundMe update about CJ. We have a lot of good and fun things happening this summer and we want to enjoy them and look forward. So have a great week everyone and happy father\\'s day to all the dads out there!+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by Chris and Amorette Rice 9 months ago Share Update #22 6-11-17Hello everybody. Friday was our 8 hour Yale day. CJ did great! He was in a great mood and was very playful and energetic. He had his LP where he received chemo in his spine. Then he had his 2 other chemos. One of them is so harsh that after it is given they flush his system out with clear fluids for 4 hours. That night I started giving him his chemo pill at home which I have to do for two weeks. Yesterday today and tomorrow a nurse comes to the house to give CJ a chemo shot in the arm. Then this coming Friday we go to the clinic so CJ can get his chemo in his port and then the following three days a nurse comes to the house again to administer a chemo shot. These next two weeks are the last big push to eradicate any cancer cells that may be hiding out anywhere in his body. Whereas the steroids used to make him ravenous now he\\'s back to hardly eating or drinking anything at all. This worries us because he\\'ll need to keep his weight and energy up for this big chemo cycle. They warn us that with all the chemo CJ will be getting over the next two weeks that his numbers will drop so low that we shouldn\\'t be surprised if he ends up needing blood and/or platelet transfusions. We just have to get through these next two weeks and then things should be pretty easy sailing over the summer even though he\\'ll still be getting chemo and steroids and going to Yale for LPs and the clinic. At least it should be a lot less intense and harsh. Until Friday...+ Read MoreUpdate 21 Posted by Chris and Amorette Rice 9 months ago Share Update 21 6-2-17So today was supposed to be our 8 hour day at Yale where CJ was supposed to have a lumbar puncture and have his chemos. They accessed his port and drew blood and while they were waiting for his numbers to come back they hooked him up to some clear fluids in preparation. His numbers came back after a while and were all great except the ANC. It was almost as low as when we were first admitted to Yale back on January 4th. So today was a no-go. His ANC was way too low to go ahead with the procedure and chemos. So now he has a free week. They told us his body just needs a break and needs more time to get back on track. First of all you could have knocked us over when they came back and told us exactly what his ANC number was. We were completely shocked! We thought for sure that it would have risen from the previous week which was double what it is today. They told us it\\'s completely normal for this to happen. So next Thursday we\\'ll go to the clinic just for a finger prick so they can run his numbers again to see if they can go ahead with the procedure and chemos next Friday. So now he\\'s back to wearing a face mask when we go to the clinic or the hospital. We are once again relegated to the house and yard at least until his ANC come back up a lot. But CJ looks and seems to feel fine. He\\'s his normal playful energetic and sweet self now that the steroids are mostly out of his system. We had no inclination based on his behavior that his ANC was so low. At first we were a little upset that he couldn\\'t get his treatment and procedure today because we look at it as the sooner he moves through his treatment on schedule the sooner he\\'s in maintenance. But on the other hand we are happy that he gets an extra week to just be a happy playful kid with no new meds and his body has an extra week to relax and clear out the remainder of the steroids and whatever else may still be in there. So that\\'s where we are. On another good note the Great Cycle Challenge began yesterday and we\\'ve surpassed our team donation goal TWICE now. First it was set at $1000 and we exceeded that. Then it was set at $1500 and we\\'ve exceeded it again. Wondering if I should increase it again. Also our team mileage goal was set at 10 miles initially because apparently I have no concept of mileage and realistically how far people go on a single ride. Yesterday my mom and I both rode 10 miles and Kim Asencio rode 16 I believe. Correct me if I\\'m wrong Kim. Last night I increased our team mileage goal to 50 miles and now we\\'ve surpassed that too and are up to 63. 8 miles ridden. So now I\\'m jacking it up to 100 miles. I know we can do it! Mom and I are planning on going out again this coming week while CJ is in a steady place at home. However I\\'m lowering my personal goal down to $500 because that\\'s the number I need to raise personally (not the team) in order to redeem my official Great Cycle Challenge jersey. I\\'ve already personally raised $245 out of $500. Initially I thought that if the team raised $500 the team leader would get the jersey but that\\'s not so. I\\'m so proud of my team! We\\'re doing amazingly well and it\\'s only the second day of the challenge. I\\'m excited to see how far we end up riding and how much we raise by the end of the challenge on June 30th. Thank you to everyone who has donated and who intends to. Thank you also for your little messages of affirmation and support. We read them all and they help keep us going.

       " '\"Update 5 Posted by Angy Borroto 19 months ago Share Dearest friends and family. We apologize for the very delayed update as we know many of you have been asking about me. As some of you know already we recently re-located back home to Miami this past weekend. A second opinion has concluded that the transplant would be risky at this time due to not having a favorable donor (my brother and I were not compatible) they feel that it would be more dangerous than beneficial to have it done at this time.The doctor\\'s at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and Miami have decided to wait and observe me until my year mark of being in remission (February) and see whether or not I relapse. Should the Leukemia not return by then the chance of it coming back drops significantly but should it return I will definitely need the transplant no matter what. My family and I are praying and are confident that I will stay in remission. To everyone who donated called texted emailed prayed etc... We thank you from the very bottom of our hearts. Without your donations the overwhelming re-location process and unexpected costs of treatment would have been nearly impossible. My family and I cannot ever fully express how truly grateful we are. Since I am currently still not able to work your donations will continue to help me to cover my medical expenses. Although I am not completely in the clear yet I am confident that with all of your continued prayers and support as well as my family\\'s that I will continue to beat this cancer and be around for a very long time. Once again I do apologize for the delayed update but we didn\\'t want to post anything until we had a solid plan of action.

We are extremely overwhelmed with all the love and support we continue to receive and greatly appreciate all the help. We wanted to give you an update on some news we received last night from Moffitt Cancer Center.On our last update it had been told to us that Amber’s siblings were not a match. It turns out Richard her brother is a 25% match to her and he will a related un-matched donor three possible donors were tested and are not a match to her unfortunately there are only 45% of Latinos & African Americans who sign up to be donors making very difficult for this group to find a match who can be 100% compatible.Although Amber is in remission and tomorrow she will finish her third consolidation chemotherapy doctors at Moffitt feel this is the best time to move forward with the procedure. The procedure Amber will have is called: Haploidentical Stem Cell TransplantAn allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell (HPC) transplant involves matching a patient’s tissue type specifically their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type with that of a related or unrelated donor. HLA proteins are found on all cells of our body and are the main way the immune system tells the difference between our own cells and foreign cells.The closer the HLA match between a donor and recipient the greater the chance a transplant will be successful.If the HLA match is not close enough the donor’s immune system which accompanies the donated stem cells recognizes the HLA mismatch and will attack the recipient’s tissues. This process is known as graft versus host disease (GVHD).Approximately 70% of people with a haematological malignancy or bone marrow failure syndrome who need an allogeneic transplant have a HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor available.For patients who need a stem cell transplant but do not have a HLA-matched related or unrelated donor recent medical advances have made possible the use of a partially matched or haploidentical related donor. A haploidentical related donor is usually a 50% match to the recipient and may be the recipient’s parent sibling or child.The advantage of having a haploidentical transplant is that it increases the chance of finding a donor as almost everyone has at least one haploidentical relative. Relatives can usually be asked to donate stem cells much more quickly than unrelated volunteer donors particularly when the volunteer donors live in other countries thereby allowing transplants to be done in a more timely way.With improvements in medical treatment complications of a haploidentical transplant such as GVHD rejection of the graft and slow recovery of the immune system appear not to be increased compared to transplants using HLA matched related or unrelated donors.Since this is a relatively new approach to stem cell transplantation a haploidentical transplant is a treatment option that is not offered in all treatment centers. Amber will begin her testing on June 6 in Tampa at Moffitt Cancer Center making this very real as time approaches very soon. We will continue posting updates as we move forward with her procedure. We ask that you keep Amber in your prayers and that she may be free from this horrible nightmare.We thank you all very much for all your help and prayers.+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Angy Borroto 22 months ago Share 11 Many family & friends have been asking us information regarding stem cell/bone marrow transplant for Amber Borroto. Neither of Amber\\'s siblings are a match and now the hospital is going through the donors list to see who is her best match.Below please find the link to register for donor match:https://bethematch.org/ they focus on recruiting new registry members ages 18 to 44. This is based on medical research that shows younger donors are best for patients and provide the greatest chance for transplant success. Because of this doctors request donors in the 18 to 44 age group more than 95% of the time.At the end of the registry you will be asked if you are doing this for someone.

       " '\"Update 8 Posted by Colleen Hammond 19 months ago Share A number of people have asked for the specifics of what I\\'m doing to successfully get rid of my breast cancer. I feel very strongly about working with a trusted doctor for your own treatment plan so what I\\'m doing may NOT work for you! Please consult a physician for your own treatment plan. That being said here is the recipe for the Gerson Green Juice that I drink a number of times a day. This is juiced using a Tribest Green Star Twin Gear juicer ( http://amzn.to/2ao2y97). Here\\'s the recipe using all organic veggies:1/2 head Romaine lettuce2 leaves of Escarole3 leaves Red leaf lettuce3 leaves Green leaf lettuce 2 leaves of Endive 4 leaves Watercress2 leaves Red Cabbage 2 Beet top leavesA quarter of a small green pepper3 leaves Swiss & Red chard 1 medium green apple (I use 1/4-1/2 an apple due to sugar and other health issues.)How does it taste you ask? Well I\\'ve grown accustomed to the taste -- it\\'s a bit like drinking a salad. But for the first week or so I was reminded of the \"\"I Love Lucy\"\" episode about VitaMeataVegamin! Here\\'s a clip. ENJOY! https://youtu.be/q2Z264w9_2Q?t=45sGreen Juice (juiced not blended)+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Colleen Hammond 19 months ago Share I just returned from a weekend in Boston where I spoke at the IHM Conference on Friday then spent Saturday touring the city with our oldest daughter Darcy. \"\"Boston\"\" was on HER bucket list and I\\'m so happy I was able to share this memory-making experience with her!I wasn\\'t able to keep one treatment appointment on Friday (\\'cuz I was in Boston!) but I\\'m making up for it this week thanks to your generous donations.

Thanks for all the love!+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Emily Lucero 9 months ago Share Coral's day has improved bit by bit. Even with the number fluctuations her team of Dr's feel she is stable enough to only draw labs twice a day instead of the four daily she's been doing. They've cleared her to walk the halls again as long as she wears a mask. She still has a cough that is proving to be really annoying as well as making her cough so hard it made her vomit a few times today. Her oncologist ordered a chest xray to see if there's any sign of infection and she is currently having that done as I type. So in conclusion the day that started out rough and discouraging has started to turn around.

To say that we couldn\\'t have done it without your support is literally the truth. It is important for all of you to know that without your donations WE WOULD NOT have been able to start the procedures necessary and the cancer would have had additional months to grow.I am so thankful to all of you for helping us with this battle. There\\'s a long road ahead in paying the medical bills but having mom\\'s health to get us through it will be a breeze compared to the last 9 months.Thank you from the bottom of my heart.And please if you ever need anything at all from me please know that I will do my best to help in any way I possibly can.LOVE.-NickPS - We\\'ve got a beautiful new baby girl in the family so you may have to wait a while for those lemon bars :)+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Nick Engvall 13 months ago Share It has been a while since I\\'ve updated everyone here and I apologize for that. This whole thing has been quite a struggle emotionally and something I am really still trying to understand and process for myself on so many different levels. It\\'s so much that even I can\\'t put it into words and I have avoided updating this because of that.I want to thank everyone who has supported with donations sharing of this GoFundMe the calls and texts and the thoughts and prayers. Mom started treatments a couple months back and starting that process would not have evened happened yet without the financial support from everyone who donated. We cannot thank you enough.My mom is about half way through treatments at this point assuming all goes well at least. There have been ups and downs but she\\'s honestly kept better spirits than I could have imagined. Today she needed a blood transfusion to help her get her energy up but she seems to be doing better judging by the smiley emojis in her texts. (Now you know where I get it :)I came across this picture of her when I was back home and it just grabbed a hold of me. Maybe it\\'s the Golden Gate Bridge and how no place in the world has ever felt more like home to me the way San Francisco does. I\\'m not really sure exactly but it\\'s really the first time I\\'ve ever looked at a picture of her and saw myself.I might not have figured out a clear path to dealing with the challenges that come with her going through radiation and chemo but it\\'s become very clear where I got my courage from. Thank you everyone for your continued support and to you Mom for showing us all how to be so courageous.+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Nick Engvall 18 months ago Share Hi allSorry it\\'s been a bit since I updated on my mom\\'s situation. Today she starts chemotherapy. If you\\'re familiar with cancer at all this is the most trying time for patients and it\\'s relatively uncertain how long the treatment will need to go on. The doctor initially suggested 3 sessions sandwiched with radiation treatments. So it will likely be a few months of treatment. All of your thoughts prayers texts calls and support is greatly appreciated.My friend Mitch at Hoosier Kicks has offered to donate a percentage of his sales this month to help us out. If you\\'re in the position to buy some new sneakers from him please do. His website is http://www.hoosierkicks.com/ and he\\'s written a great post about the sneaker community.

It\\'s been a tough week for myself and my family. My mom had her procedure this week and she is recovering slowly but surely.The surgery went well and the doctor was able to remove a lot of the cancer. Unfortunately it has spread beyond what was removable in this procedure. The good thing is that my mom will be in less pain once she heals from this procedure. The downside is we don\\'t know the extent of what is to come in terms of procedures or treatments.We\\'re taking it one step at a time and trying to stay positive. We\\'ll find out the next steps towards the end of the coming week.As most of you know me from the sneaker world I want to share one of the amazing things about this community.

We love him dearly and pray that he may always know that we love both he and Jayden with all our hearts! He is the best brother Jayden could have asked for ??????Amazing Brother!!!+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Dana Mueller 16 months ago Share A few updates from Jen today. First is from this morning. JAYDEN\\'S UPDATE...He is hanging in there and making a little progress. He got out of bed a little last night and this morning. He also ate a little Jello. He still had a fever of 102 this morning. Doctor says he will likely need to stay through the weekend and perhaps could go home on Monday (Halloween). I am thinking if he is home by then of having a \"\"reverse\"\" trick-or-treat for him where his friends come to the door and say hi and give him a piece of candy. Depends on his immunity though. Anyway until he is fever free for 24 hours he cannot be released. His coughing is still there but the cough meds are helping. They still need to keep an eye on his breathing and his lungs a bit. He loved watching the Cubs win last night and we did play cards for a while so he is in good spirits. Doc says he will still need his spinal chemo next week :( Just taking one step at a time right now. Thanks everyone for your prayers and support keep it all coming!Happy Cubs Fan!!+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Dana Mueller 16 months ago Share Please see Jen\\'s update from this morning! Gonna be a tough week for the little man! Prayers are needed!! \"\"Jayden was admitted to the hospital last night with a high fever and will likely be there several days. Not sure yet but likely is viral. His body will be fighting hard right now because of his low immunity. His oxygen is low so he has an oxygen mask -- if it lowers he will be put in ICU. Please pray for him that his body is able by to fight off whatever this is. Doc says this is not uncommon for this phase of treatment but still feeling very scary. Prayers are welcome!\"\"Jen - Jayden\\'s momAll smiles even heading to the hospital!+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Dana Mueller 16 months ago Share Hi everyone!I apologize that I haven\\'t posted in a while. I have had the pleasure of spending time with Jayden and Justin again now that Aunt Cheri is back home and school is back on. Jen recently posted an update in Caring Bridge and I wanted to share it here! Please see below from Jayden\\'s mom. October 19th UpdateJournal entry by Jen Eguchi — 10/20/2016My sincere apologies for such a HUGE delay in posting updates here! I\\'m afraid life got so chaotic that I fell out of my routine of weekly or even bi-weekly updates. I am going to try to do better to keep you all informed. First the most obvious thing everyone wants to know -- how is Jayden??? He is doing fabulous! Many changes have occurred since my last update but I will hit on the main ones for my update. Jayden returned to school this Fall and has been going fairly regularly! He was so excited to go back and to be in the same class as his brother Justin! Everyone gave him such a warm welcome and this had him beaming with happiness. There are still days he has to miss -- either he has chemo or he isn\\'t feeling well but I think we have been quite lucky he has been able to go as much as he has.He has a new look ;) Yes he lost his hair but he is handling it very well. Though so many parents and children offered their support to shave as well have a shaving party etc. this is just not what Jayden seemed to want. He didn\\'t want a big deal made out of it and he just wanted his hair to fall out naturally. So...he still has some \"\"peach fuzz\"\" hair and it will be there until it either falls out or the rest grows back in! I came to the realization Jayden has to do this his own way and that I would not \"\"push\"\" him to get shaved. He wears hats most of the time unless he is home and then he seems content without one. He graduated from Physical Therapy! At the end of August we got an awesome report from his Physical Therapist Joe that Jayden has progressed with his walking/running etc to the point he does not need his regularly scheduled PT sessions anymore! He may need more in the future as the chemo he is on unfortunately does impact the leg and foot muscles...but for now he is good! He completed his hospital (in-patient) chemo! That was an 8 week long phase where he was admitted every other week for a minimum of 2 overnights. He handled it like a champ and that is now behind us! The rest of his chemo is all out-patient through the clinic. Jayden has completed 7 months of chemo so we are so thankful that he has done so well! Our hope is that by early next year he will be in Maintenance mode which will mean a lot less chemo for him. It\\'s still a long road and it breaks my heart to think he will be 12 years old by the time he is done -- so I prefer to look at how far we\\'ve come instead of the road ahead and continue to take the latter day-by-day which Jayden has taught me to do through his attitude throughout this whole thing. So we have been richly blessed with all of the above tribulations. We finished off the summer with a \"\"bang\"\" by having lots of fun with Aunti Cheri before she had to leave to pursue her next work assignment. Currently Jayden is going through what should be the toughest phase of his remaining treatment schedule. This phase includes chemo 4x per week 2 weeks in a row and typically is accompanied by flu-like symptoms: fever vomiting muscle fatigue etc. Jayden has indeed been feeling some of these effects since the start of the phase on Monday and is not likely to go to school too much over the course of the next 3 weeks. Still he is in wonderful spirits :) We simply have to keep moving forward and get through this together so that we can get it behind him. Justin has been an outstanding brother to Jayden. They are so lucky to have each other. While it is still very hard to keep things balanced during these times for the boys I really must say that for the most part I think Justin is behaving quite \"\"normally\"\" and has done well adjusting to some of the changes. Many of you also inquire about how I am doing. Thanks to all of my wonderful family and friends I am doing just fine. I certainly have my ups and downs but I am doing the best I can to take care of myself as I know how important that is. I feel blessed to have all that I do and my Faith keeps me strong. I know we will all help Jayden through this together. Thanks a million to everyone for your continued prayers and support! You have all meant the world to our family!LoveJen Jayden and JustinJayden and Justin school pics Fall 2016+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Although our nerves are extremely unsettled without the nurses being 15 ft away from us when we need them we know we can do this. The support that has been shown for Jeremy during this trying time has been beautifully overwhelming and we could spend our whole life saying how much it means to us and that still wouldnt be enough time.

       " \"Update 10 Posted by Tammy Lackey Currier 37 months ago Share Family and friends wanted to give you and update on Ian and once again ask for you for your help. Ian is doing good. He just got finished with another extensive chemo treatment and is doing well. However with that being said as they were on their way home from the hospital yesterday they were involved in a serious car accident. They are fine and doing good and I give thanks to our awesome Mighty God we serve for sending his angels and putting a hedge of protection around them because if you could see the car you would understand why I say we serve a mighty God. Another foot and the impact and hit would have caved/crushed the side that Ian was sitting on. Melissa Deiters? their is a love from our God that covers all darkness and defeats these circumstances and obstacles that the enemy keeps throwing at us and putting in our paths. I want you to know how much I love you and all others and how proud of you I am. I know there are days you want to just fall scream and shout and you are at your breaking point but you remain strong for your family. I love you honey and we will get through this and we will get it all worked out. Family and friends I want to again thank you for meeting our first initial goal but as you know it does not go far when you are paying for copays prescriptions and are unable to work full time and if she is lucky enough to work two days a week to cover health insurance premiums when Ian is not in and out of hospital. And the monthly bills are still due the electric mortgage etc. and now to top it off having to pay a deductible to get a car fixed depending on what insurance decides I am not good with my words ad do not mean to sound redundant or babble on I am just asking for your help I need it they need it to survive like any other ordinary family. I will be posted this on the GoFund me link also. Please whatever your heart might lead you to donate whether it be $1 $5 or $10 again whatever you feel lead to help with.

We are a little over halfway to our goal. I would like to encourage everyone to keep sharing and donating and to continue to keep the family in your prayers. As I sit here updating Ian's page I look at his picture and think. This is a 6 year old boy having to endure more at 6 than most will in a lifetime. He is kind energetic. thoughtful and just a terrific kid. Ian is one of those kids teachers and parents dream of. He is strong and is a fighter. Ian was suppose to start first grade on August 19 but had to withdraw due to his diagnosis on going chemo treatments and other challenges he is facing. This family needs our help. Ian's parents Melissa and Dean along with little sister Mya would have never imagined that he would have been diagnosed with cancer. Having your child diagnosed with cancer is unimaginable ordeal for any family as well as adding on extra financial challenges can be overwhelming. Please help this family as they face a long road ahead. They need our support financially and our continuation of prayers. Please take a few moments to share the link make a donation say a prayer.

The type of cancer he has as likes to be in the spinal fluid that surrounds the brain. Today he will get a spinal tap to see if 1) the cancer is there and 2) to get one of the types of chemo directly in there. No matter what he will get chemo into a spinal tap several times during the next month. If it is in the spinal fluid it will change his stage and he will get more spinal chemo. He will also get a bone marrow biopsy. If it is in the bone marrow he will need a bone marrow transplant. It also will change this too but we aren\\'t there yet. Lastly he will get an ekg because one of the chemo drugs can affect the heart. Today is also day one of chemo. On different days he will get a different regiment of drugs. For at least 29 days.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 1.6k shares on Facebook Read a Previous UpdatePrevious update You\\'re on update 6 5 4 3 2 1 Next update\"',\n",

Last week on Wednesday she was admitted to the hospital and had to stay there for 4 days as she received her 2nd round of chemo. She was released for a few days but will be re admitted to the hospital @ City of Hope on Wednesday for yet another round of chemo and will be staying at the hospital for about 1 week. It has been really hard for my sister to work since she constantly has to go back to the hospital for check ups and to stay for several days. Her being self employed is harder because if she doesn't work she doesn't get paid. Dane'lle's dad Danny also has to take time off from work to be with their daughter. Thank you all for the donations they have really helped them tremendously and helps release some of the stress of not having to worry about their finances as much at this time.

I transfered care from Temple to U PENN and am much happier with my new doctor who will sit with me for at least 30min but up to and over sn hour to talk about my condition possible treatments and just life in general. Theres a lot going on right now. I NEED TO GET INTO REMISSION SOON WE ARE TRYING ANOTHER 10 DAY CHEMO PROTOCAL. I NEED A BONE MARROW DONOR STILL JOIN FOR FREE HERE WWW.MARROW.ORG ITS FREE AND EASY A SIMPLE MOUTH SWAB TO GET STARTED. Other than those two things I\\'m at U PENN being treated for fevers pneumonia and starting my new chemo. The spinal tap didnt go so well today so we try again with an xray machine tomorrow morning. April has been a tough month finacially for my whole family and we ask for donations in any amount you can spare to help with insurance stability on my dental insurance which is starting to get out of conyrol and parking frees and tolls at the new hospital. Things are getting better I feel and I remain very faithful that I will experience 100% cure from transpant. I was able to visit a few friends for a weekend recently which wws wonderful but I ended up rushing home for treatments. We hope to go into transplant before summer which means I could be experiencing good health by september. Lets keep that in our prayers! As for what I have been into personally... I\\'ve become a bit of a health nut learning about high quality supplements and othere exotic products. Im waiting on a miracle it seems. Another project i am thinking out is a website to be purchased for three years that simplifies marrow.org and links people to marro.org as well as tracks my recruiting efforts im hopinh to have 1000000 people join which means I need more time on Earth. I\\'m waiting for donations to start the site then I hope run the site off paypal donations it wont be so much a personal site like this but an educational one linking to marrow.org and practices that have personally helped me or others with blood cancer. Most importantly signs and symptoms. Ive decided to get into non profit work when I\\'m healthier. Ive been playing music for health mainly japanese prayer flute but also digeridoo and flutes they help to clear my mind. My wife and I picked up an 8 stage water filter that mineralizes the water with a layer or rocks we we havent turned back. Its like a brita filter on roids. So theres the news some good some facts but all hopefull. I thank in advance for your support. Im tired a lot of the time which keeps me from more updates find me on facebook (daniel.silver.9) and help us when you can please!+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by Daniel Silver 60 months ago Share WELL!!!!!! I feel like I am once again in HELL. My cancer relapsed last week (3-3-13) right when I thought I would be going into recovery getting ready to rejion the work force and getting my life together with my wife. I was even planning a small little breather trip to visit some friends in NC for a weekend. BUT NOW THAT IS ALL IN SHAMBBLES. I have to get a bone marrow transplant donor prep for multiple surgeries receive my spinal taps and other various forms of chemo therapy. Just like I wanted to start my Sprnig! NOT!!! Luckly while I am still completly swammped in bills over my head there is a very very small amount of aid coming through so that I can eat healthy and get to the doctors by gathering all my money together. Everyone wants to go in their own direction it seems which is only fair and I was once very much a lonery independant type but thatr isnt how the world works and the sooner we eralized that when we are young the better off in life we all shall me. So let that person have that parking space or that extra seat at the pub you cant take it with you. would you even really remember the jesture if you could? I feel horrible for bringing my wife through this hell but equally i feel blessed that god could bring a person so quickly into my life who gives me something work fighting for. I can\\'t have children i cant have homes and lots of cars anymore but I can have this heart that beats to see my wife Elina in the money which honeslty is the only reason i continue to endure any of these treatments. they are painful I am always in pain and its nobodies fault but that is that nature we live in. I use to be philosphical pondering lifes whims but to be truthful i am just happy to be typing this sentance sitting up with out a headache thats all the philosophy i need. So this is the restart about this time last year we had some idea something was wrong with me but this time we know its cancer (leukemia to be exact (tcell)).I have cried enough for everyone so dont worry about that department. I came home today which is great my counts are about normal but its a true rollarcoast and nobody knows chit in reality. Most chemo treatments from here on out will be at home based but in about 2 or 3 months i will get a transplant and that will require1 or 2 months in a hospital. I had more visitors this time during my stay but i feel its cause they dont think they will see me again or something. im still around. The doctors say we are going to CURE no EXTENTION \"\"CURE\"\" Thats big news in the cancer world. but to be frank with you I just want to jump off a 20ft high dive everyday as much as i want without having to worry about a chest port getting wet or some god foresaken infection to rear up in my chinese food. love yourself people and if you cant do that just say it for me even if you know you arent a very lovely person you would be supprized who does feel that way about you. look at me! I am ranting theres so much to say and i havent been on in a while. but i do want to thank you for your support and donations. my mom is very sick and has a hard time helping me meet bills my wife is struggling to get rooted and help and as for me while i may not be bedridden currently i have a feeling its going to happen again with these spinal injections again.peace be with you and i will try not to be a stranger and if you are a stranger your not as much as you think you are cause your blood products could be my next day and no stranger can give that kinda of give. you are either a brother or a sister.Love DanielPlease share this post and donate if you can its really helps when all the little things start adding up+ Read MoreUpdate 21 Posted by Daniel Silver 61 months ago Share I finished my last round of chemo last Monday (1/28/13). This was my 16th round of chemo and the last of the intensive stuff. I am rebounding and in two weeks I will have my central tri-port taken out which means I can take showers and swim again. The first time in 7 or 8 months! The 16th round really knocked me out. I was immediately ill and couldn\\'t really function for 7 or 8 days. then I slowly rebounded but currently my red blood cell count is dropping which makes simple tasks take forever and they seem very exhausting. Tomorrow (2/6/13) I am getting 2 blood transfusions which should help tremendously but they give you benidryl which seems to have a strong effect on my wakefulness. Currently I have no immune system so I can not leave my room to say the least. I have been sprouting heirloom tomato cucumber lettuces basil oregano varieties and thyme and building little hydroponic units to grow them in while I wait in recovery. I find the hobby highly rewarding and I am learning a lot about biology chemistry horticulture and botany. its been something fun for me to do lately. I wish I was more into reading like I was before I had cancer but I just find the topic tiresome and I quickly fall asleep to most books I pick up. I sleep a lot to build my immune system. I thank you for your support and following my threads during this whole ordeal. My doctor said I have a 70% chance to stay in remission and after 5 years of remission my statistics go up significantly. However during this whole ordeal I have made significant life changes reanalyzed my life with all this time I have been given. I am still in the process of acceptance and coping with what happen exactly. I virtually missed out on 8 months of life and I am still in the process of sorting and dealing with current issues. I ignored bills because I was entirely too sick to deal with the stresses and that was not wise because now that I have more strength I am paying for that negligence. Luckily I have had close friends and family for support. I wish I could raise more money to get straightened out both medically and financially. These are my biggest stresses that I think about because I am newly married and want a fresh start at life. I have been given a new lease to life but there is still a lot of cleaning up to do I do believe.Thanks again and please shareDaniel+ Read MoreUpdate 20 Posted by Daniel Silver 63 months ago Share I just got home from my 7th round of chemo I am feelig very ill and I am sorry I haven\\'t had more to say.

       " '\"Update 6 Posted by Stephanie Lank 12 months ago Share Journal entry by Joanne Schwerdtmann — 9 hours agoAs you all know we had our day downtown yesterday at Northwestern. Full day of events! Dan had his PET scan in the morning then we had labs drawn all done before noon Our appointment with his oncologist at 3:00 and then they wanted us to meet with a dermatologist who wanted to see Dan\\'s rash and help figure out the itching. We had some downtime in between and decided to walk a couple of blocks to Lake Shore Drive. We found a bench to sit and just look out at age Michigan and off to the right we were watching the ferries wheel go around at Navy Pier. February 21st and we were sitting outside with no jackets. Crazy Chicago weather! It was nice to just sit and take a breather before we went to his appointment to find out the results of the scan and how Dan\\'s body has responded to the treatments. We checked in for his appointment and we were called right away. Amazingly we were both pretty calm - we had decided earlier that we have no control over the outcome and whatever it was we just deal with head on. The medical assistant came in and took Dan\\'s vitals and said that the doctor would be in soon. There are several people that work with Dr. Sosman and one of his assistants came in to take Dan\\'s history and ask the usual questions. He mentioned that the final report was not back from the PET scan but Dr. Sosman and Lisa were reviewing the scan and comparing with the scan done when Dan was diagnosed with his cancer. He left and said they would be shortly. Longest 10 minutes ever!!! The door open and Dr. Sosman Lisa Wade and another gentlemen walked in. Could not get a read on their faces.....Dr. Sosman began to ask Dan some questions and assesd his pain and itching. He then took a blank piece of paper and began to write down all the places Dan had his cancer. Then he went back up to the top of the list and began to cross off one by one the places and stating at the same time Not Seen Not Seen Not Seen!!! What? My mind was trying to catch up with the crossing off each line and trying to really process what he was saying? I felt the tears rolling down my cheeks and then looked up at Lisa and Wade and they were smiling. I then said wait Not Seen - does that mean the cancer is not there? Dr. Sosman said the spots that previously lit up on the scan were no longer there. Out of the 8 spots the cancer was there is now only 1 spot that lit up on the scan all the rest of the spots of cancer are gone! Kept pinching myself to see if I was awake or was this a dream. Dr. Sosman said the only spot that was still there was in the pelvic bone. It did look smaller but was still there. He wants Dan to have an MRI to get a closer look to see what\\'s going on in that spot. Did this just happen??? We did this treatment because it was the only chance at a cure but only a 10% chance of a cure we were told. Dan joked befor his treatment started that when he went to have his first treatment he was going to tell the other 9 people on the floor to go home becuase was going to be the winner. He looked at me and said told you I was going to be the winner. The plan now is to have an MRI in the next week and then meet with Dr. Sosman in 4 weeks to see what next. Dan won\\'t have anymore IL2 treatments but he did mention possible radiation treatment for the pelvic area. We then met with the dermatologist to see how we can manage the itch and rash. She did determine this is all from the treatment. We came up with a plan and will give it 2 weeks to see if it works. I just wanted to go to the top off the roof and yell \"\"Thank You God\"\" We then started texting the kids and calling family to let everyone know the good news. The rest of the evening was a blur I didn\\'t want to update Caringbridge because I still could not believe this was happening. I wanted to wait until the official typed report before typing this message. I went to work today and Dr. Stoecker our primary got the report and printed it and handed it to me - all there in black and white! I read it and cried. We are so thankful for all your prayers. Prayer in numbers is very powerful. Still trying to process this wonderful news. Love and prayers to all - Dan-Joni and family.+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Stephanie Lank 13 months ago Share Please join us on Feb. 4th for a Fundraiser Benefiting Dan! The event will be held in Elburn IL - please check out our flyer for more information. + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Stephanie Lank 13 months ago Share An Update from Joni- Dan is now back home after his second cycle of Interleuken 2 treatment at Northwestern/Prentice Hospital. This cycle was tougher than the first time. This time Dan\\'s kidney behaved and they watched his kidney levels more closely this time. Unfortunately Dan developed Capillary Leak Syndrome from the treatment and they could not control his blood pressure and was sent to the ICU. We are very thankful for the fast acting measures that were taken in the ICU to control his blood pressure and to avoid intubation. Dan is home but having many difficulties from the treatment this time. We are still having issues with shortness of breath and a very rapid heart rate and a rash with itching that is driving him insane. Dan was only able to complete 6 out 14 treatments this cycle between the 2 cycles he was able to complete 15 treatments total. Dan will repeat all his scans in late February to see if the tumors are shrinking or have responded to the treatment? We are all praying for a miracle. We are so thankful for all the prayers love and support. + Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Stephanie Lank 15 months ago Share Dan checked into Northwestern Prentice Hospital and started his Interleuken 2 treatment in November 28th. First cycle is 14 treatments he received 9 treatments before we had to stop. Dan\\'s only kidney shut down from the treatment. It has been a long extra 6 days so far trying to get his kidney to wake up! His levels are slowing coming back down & we are getting more urine output each day. We both can\\'t wait to get home to our own house. Not sure when we will be able to go home? Dan & I and the kids are so thankful for your love support & prayers.Joni Dan Bryan Michelle Andy Kim Alex and all our Grandchildren.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 8 Posted by Tracy Brande 13 months ago Share 22 Finally have started on chemo!!! We got tired of waiting for Hilton Head hHospital to decide if they would approve the chemo (BCBS already approved but I was told that what they reimbursed wouldn\\'t cover even basic costs- so I think they were delaying and delaying an approval so that we would go somewhere else. They were hoping to deny without getting sued).Kudos to MUSC . I texted Beth Crane about our 3 week delays and frustrations and she forwarded the text to Dr. Paul O\\' Brien and he called us on a SATURDAY personally to say that he would get us started within the week. And he did!Just got home from Charleston and first treatment. Dante is feeling a little nauseated and tired but seems happy to be started on the road to treatment. Can\\'t say enough positive things about MUSC. They really seem to care about the patient and their care rather than their insurance and what money they will make or lose. Thank God for their compassion and care.+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Tracy Brande 14 months ago Share 22 Dante is 3 days into radiation treatment right now. He\\'s super fatigued from it already and is sleeping a lot. For people who want to come by the house for a short visit he\\'s usually awake around 5:30 or 6 pm and up for a couple of hours.He\\'ll be getting his staples taken out of his 10 inch incision that runs from below his chest down past his belly button taken out after Christmas. Once he\\'s finished with radiation we should be starting chemotherapy in Hilton Head with Dr. Thomas. We also have an appointment in January with MUSC for a second opinion. We are hoping that if chemo can shrink the cantaloupe size tumor that he may be able to have some of it removed at that point. We\\'ve been told that it\\'s inoperable due to its size and how it\\'s spread into other areas around the intestines but we are still hoping for miracles.Continue on with the prayers and well wishes and finger and toe crossings. Thanks again to everyone for the support and love!+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Tracy Brande 14 months ago Share 11 We are now home from the hospital and arrived to the famous Hurricane Matthew welcome home sign. Thanks to Byron and thanks to all the little elves who put up our Chritmas lights and decorated a tree- Clark Griswald would be proud.Dante will start radiation on Monday to try to prevent any further bone loss from the cancer that spread to two spots on his spine and hip. The colon and liver tumors will hopefully respond well to the chemo he\\'ll start after finishing radiation. We again thank everyone for all the support and love we\\'ve received. It definitely shows what a great community Hilton Head is and how lucky we are to have such good friends and family!Dante\\'s welcome home to a famous sightSee you later room 301!+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Tracy Brande 14 months ago Share Hi to everyone again this is Tracy Brande Dante\\'s forever fiancée.

Here we are 2 days before my sister's next surgery. My sister will be getting the DIEP Surgery on Friday to start her reconstruction. DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforators) flap surgery is a cutting-edge breast reconstruction procedure that uses a flap of complete tissue - blood vessels (perforators) skin and fat - from a woman’s lower abdomen as donor tissue. The flap is then transferred to the chest where the surgeon aided by a microscope will attach the donor tissue blood vessels to the chest blood vessels and reconstruct the breast. This delicate procedure provides significant benefits such as a slimmer appearance a natural-looking breast maintained core strength and a quick recovery. Please keep her in your prayers and keep sharing this page. Every dollar counts. Thank you all again for your support. I will give you an update on Friday after she comes out of surgery.

       " '\"Update 23 Posted by David Parker 2 days ago Share An update on David’s recovery.With all good news to give David had his first scan post surgery the doctor says the liver looks great. It has even began to rejuvenate a little bit no lymph nodes are showing activity and his cancer markers have gone from 86 to 2. We are so pleased!He will have another scan in three months and if all still looks good he will get to start doing scans every six months instead. He will be going back to UCSF to have a reversal surgery soon. They will remove the ileostomy bag and maneuver the large colon into the position of being used regularly. Right now he’s only connected to the small colon while he heals. There will be a 4 to 6 month healing period and the doctors will watch it very closely.This is all fabulous news considering last March he was told he had stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer and not great chances of beating it. It’s hard to hear the words “you have 6 to 9 months to live“ but you have a lot to live for so you fight!After very long surgeries at UCSF having more than half of the liver removed gallbladder removed rerouted arteries from the heart removal of 14 lymph node’s large portion of the large colon removed removal of the full rectum And All tissues surrounding it it is surreal to hear the words “cancer free”.The healing process will still take a very long time but well worth it of course.I will keep you all posted of the next long surgery coming soon.We want to thank everyone of you for all your love and support and of course for the many prayers as we feel the power of prayer is the foundation of this recovery and beating cancer.God still has more for David to do!+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by David Parker 4 months ago Share We are finally home.Starting this last March with stage 4 colorectal cancer and was told he wouldn’t see Christmas....he went through VERY Aggressive chemotherapy removed more than half his liver re routed the artery from the heart removed gallbladder removed nearly half his large intestine (colon) removed the full rectum with ALL tissues around it and under anesthesia for 15+ hours.He is Home and CANCER FREE in 7 months.WHEW!!!!One more surgery to reverse the ileostomy and reconnect the colon and he will be down to scans on the liver every 3 months for awhile then 6 months.They say if the cancer returns it would be in the liver!!Thank you everyone for the continued prayers and so much support. You are all amazing.Trisha Parker+ Read MoreUpdate 21 Posted by David Parker 4 months ago Share In San Fransisco for pre op ...... Surgery tomorrow at noon at UCSF. They anticipate approximately 6 hours for surgery.I will keep you posted!+ Read MoreUpdate 20 Posted by David Parker 5 months ago Share Update from Trisha: Manymany many have been asking:David is 6 weeks post op and healing well.He saw the Chief of colorectal surgery at UCSF last Friday . She feels she can do the surgery without a colostomy bag having to be put in place permanently. She gave us so much insight on the surgery itself and the differences between having a colostomy bag and not having one. Neither is great but not having to have one seems to be the better.While visiting the oncologist in Chico at the Cancer Center she did tell David that he is healing well and the first surgery went so well that it has changed his outcome very positively. Of course we could not be happier with that news than we already are. Remember this adventure started with \"\"terminal\"\" 15% chance of beating this and 6-9 months to live which could have been extended with chemo but not beaten.David will be starting chemotherapy again very soon same chemo only not as aggressive thankfully they are currently trying to decide if they are going to forgo the radiation and go straight into surgery or not right now.They did however clear David to go to work. There is not much physical activity (David is a County Building Inspector) so he is very happy and started back to work yesterday. He really just needed some normalcy in his life even if it\\'s short-lived it is very welcomed.The next large surgery is going to be very similar to the first one 1 to 2 weeks stay in the hospital and recovery of six weeks. You have to wear a colostomy bag around four weeks after surgery to allow healing and prevent infection then another surgery will be done to remove the bag rerouted the Colon and allow the body to learn to work a different way.Colon Cancer Surgery and Colorectal Cancer Surgery are very different.Regardless of the treatments his next surgery will be soon most likely within 3-5 weeks.More updates to come soon.Remember when you are praying to Include David and our Family please.Thank YouTrisha+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 2 Posted by Madison Wolfe 9 months ago Share So on the date of moms last radiation treatment we discovered that her T10 (that was the original spot that was most invaded by cancer) is now officially cancer free but is also now cracked and her vertebrae is broken and she is at risk for paralysis. My mother had always been against chemotherapthy and had opted to do radiation spot treatment as well as hormone therapy. Unfortunately her cancer is very aggressive and has already spread to her sternum as well as her lung. She has decided to at least try chemo and is getting a port put in this week. She is also meeting with a neurosurgeon to see what the options are for management of her broken vertebrae.

Know that I am reading to her who is donating and the messages you are posting. Know that she is very grateful and embarrassed that she can no longer personally thank each of you.

Just figured out how. It is St. Baldrick's. You can contact our local rep for them who is Garrett Lamp. I do not know his contact information currently but I am sure one of my Merrit Island friends can provide that. It would also help me so I can get him the $5000 check in Dawn's name.+ Read MoreUpdate 28 Posted by Dawn Faust Bibby 19 months ago Share For those who have been following Dawn's journey we are approaching the end.Dawn has decided to take $5000 of the money raised and re-donate that to the Children's cancer charity mentioned at the beginning. We do not know how much her treatments co-pays out of pockets will run and it may well deplete this account. It may not. I know we paid almost $2000 for the medical transport to get her to the Hospice from Miami. Huge snafu there.Her goal is to be CERTAIN that charity gets a goodly chunk of the money raised and I agree completely. We also ask that instead of sending flowers to Hospice send her a card telling her how much you would have spent on flowers and instead donated to her Children's cancer Charity which can be looked up at our original post  but I think is St Judes.I apologize for not being my normal precise self but I have lots of balls in the air.All current and future donations received by this GFM will be used to pay for Dawn's final expenses the outstanding medical expenses expenses dealing with her hospice stay. If anything remains after that John (me) will use the money to help me get stable financially as I have not worked in 3 weeks nor worked consistently over the last 6 weeks. Not to mention our Amazon business has been on autopilot this entire month.I know this is not the original stated purpose of this fund. Anyone who would like me to do differently with their donation is welcome to tell me and I will do as requested with those funds to include a refund.+ Read MoreUpdate 27 Posted by Dawn Faust Bibby 19 months ago Share Hello everyoneThis is John.I have been a bit remiss in posting updates. We have been a bit busy the last few days and to be quite honest I was not really aware of how this all worked.In our marriage we have a very nice division of labor and as I have been doing all the things Dawn can't do she insisted that she be the one to manage her GFM account. She has personally written every single thank you and has attempted to personalize each one. But she is now incapable of doing so well more accurately she is conserving her strength to spend it with visiting family.I want to mention a few things.For those who are not aware. Dawn is in her last few days of life on this earth. She is at peace with that. The medicines she was on were doing great things against the cancer in her Lymph system and her lungs. Unfortunately the disease mutated when it went to her liver. That cancer was not hormone receptive so a hormone based therapy was doing nothing. Likely due to the lateness of the finding of the new outbreak even if we had chosen a different drug the outcome would have only been slightly delayed.For those who are local. She is at The Hospice House at 661 Eyser (pretty sure its)road in Rockledge Florida. I will apologize in advance for her weakness and my need to triage people as they come to see her. Her kids etc will get first dibs and individual time. They are coming over at about 9:30 this am (monday 8/1/16). After that anyone and everyone who loves Dawn is welcome.*Please do not send flowers. Although Dawn loves flowers she would much rather the money go to a more permanent thing. I will post on that soon.

Once we got things rolling I was in a much better state of mind. No initial nausea or side-effects. I felt a little woozy but that might have been due to my mental state. But the day went off without incident and we were able to get out an hour earlier than expected. The rest of that week was full of appointments and injections designed to lessen the side-effects along the way. I was able to control the nausea eat well and stay hydrated. I’ve been doing my part to stay physically active by working out several times a week and eating healthy. Thanks to my dear friend and old trainer Carlos I have been using this new app called Gixo. It allows me to workout on my schedule in my home with excellent trainers who customize your activity based on your need. I know this is just the beginning but I’m feeling positive!

The first Pet Scan showed that the cancer had not grown but also had not shrunk any. Please keep me in your prayers. I feel these pills are making me more sick than the 10 months of regular chemo that I did the first time the cancer spread to my colon!

We want a healthy Debbie back! Texas MD Anderson is NOT going to work out after all.... the $21000 needed was just to walk in the door and then she would need to have another $200000 to $300000 which IS absolutely crazy however we found another place in Boston called The Dana Farber Institute which DOES treat and research IBC and has trials by the NIH. Terri got a lot of good info and that facility looks promising and thanks to ALL of YOU for donating on Debbie's behalf she has the money to move forward. Please CONTINUE to share the GoFundMe page because I see that there are people donating who don't even know Debbie but feel compassion for her after reading her story. Debbie has also opened up a separate new bank account for her medical donations so that the GoFundMe donations will transfer electronically right to her. For anyone who does not wish to use the GoFundMe website and would rather give her a donation by check please send me a private message. I will give you my address. I do ask that everyone makes checks payable to Debbie NOT me please. I will deposit them into her bank account for her.+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Dawn Rose Geigan 16 months ago Share Hey folks.

Usually Deidre updates everyone on how she is feeling and what is happening. Unfortunately her cancer has progressed faster than expected and she is not on the computer much anymore. In her last post she had updated everyone that she is on oxygen all the time. This has helped her breathing but she has still been in pain in her back and legs. Last week we felt we needed to involve Hospice and they have been very helpful in bringing a bed and needed equipment to help her feel more comfortable. Just yesterday we began giving her morphine to help her rest and be comfortable.We ask for your prayer support. As much as we would love to have Deidre with us we also do not want her to be suffering.We also need your financial support. In 2 months we have to pay back the medical loan that allowed Deidre to get treatment in Mexico.To sum up where we are physically emotionally mentally and spiritually I am reminded of a song by Lauren Daigle:\"\"When You don\\'t move the mountains I\\'m needing You to moveWhen You don\\'t part the waters I wish I could walk throughWhen You don\\'t give the answers as I cry out to YouI will trust I will trust I will trust in You!\"\"We don\\'t know and understand why this is happening but we do know the One who holds our lives in His hands and we trust Him!\"\"On Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand.\"\"We love you and thank you for walking with us on this journey!If you need to contact me my email is schadrob@gmail.comBlessingsRob and kids+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Ben (my twin brother) is now considered operable! We were told numerous times he would never be operable because of how the cancer is in multiple organs. It feels surreal that we are about to take this aggressive step but we know Ben is strong and believe he will recover swiftly then return to chemo as soon as possible. We are asking for donations to help make the next steps of treatment (after this surgery) possible.On March 2nd 2018 Ben will be undergoing a liver resection procedure at UWMC performed by a renowned surgeon. The cancer is not going to be removed from the lungs or colon until a later time. We have been told that it is unlikely that we will find a lung surgeon in this area that will be willing to do the procedure he will need so travel costs are expected to be significant.Since this cancer journey began in June of 2016 we have received so much support and love in many ways from friends family our community and even strangers on the internet.

The amount of strides she has made over these last 11 days are astonishing! She is slowly getting stronger and continues to fight everyday. It is our turn to fight for her. Our goal of getting her the best treatment may be delayed but has not wavered. Any donation small or large can make a huge impact. I implore you to also like and share her story to help us spread it far and wide. Help us take a stand against Cancer!Finally looking more like herself+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Jennifer Velez 7 months ago Share This week has been an emotional rollercoaster. On Wednesday August 2 I took my mother to the emergency room because she was weak and dehydrated. At the hospital we found out that she was actually in sepsis shock from an infection due to the stent placed in her liver. Over the following days her organs started to shut down and she was placed on life support. On Friday we were told she would not make it through the weekend between the massive infection and stage 4 cancer. Despite the odds being stacked against her as her chance of survival was minimal we attempted a Hail Mary. After 2 days on life support she began to wake up. When the doctors attempted to pull the ventilator tube from her throat she woke up and pulled it out herself. Over the last 3 days she continued to get stronger. Her organs are now responding to treatment and the infection is slowing being contained. She is regaining her faculties and now recognizes her loved ones. This is great for us since she was a little delirious for the first 2 days after being on life support.Although my mother is facing an uphill battle at this point she has proved every doctor who has encountered her in the ICU wrong. When everyone counted her out she fought for her life despite the fact she still has to face the stage 4 cancer. She is the true definition of a fighter. Even though this was a set back in getting her to the Cancer Treatment Center of America her goal has not changed. We are determined now more than ever to get her the treatment she needs to beat this cancer once she is strong enough to travel. If she proved the doctors wrong once she can do it again. But we cannot do this alone. Give her a fighting chance and help make this treatment a reality for her. Any donations whether small or large can make a world of a difference! I hope you consider supporting her fight because she has not given up and neither will I. Yours trulyDenise\\'s biggest fan (Jennifer)Feeding mom to keep her strongShe is a fighter!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Jennifer Velez 7 months ago Share 11 I would like to take a second to thank everyone for their hard work in spreading my mothers story especially those kind enough to make a donation.

She has done 2 rounds of chemo here while we wait to be sent to Chicago and it feels like it cannot happen fast enough! The effects have not been great to say the least. But she is a fighter and will continue to fight for as long as she can. So please keep sharing and contributing if you can. No amount is too small. I know it may seem tedious but every share and donation brings us one step closer to saving her. Time is of the essence in this situation.

       " '\"Update 3 Posted by Nadine Ruiz-Carlson 18 months ago Share Hi everyone! An update from Mr. Derek Wilson:\"\"It has been a long journey without a doubt and I continue to be appreciative to everyone for their continuous love and support during the past six months. Please know that each and every one of you were a huge factor in contributing to \"\"saving my life\"\" Having your team support was a huge part of my healing process.I am still consulting with two doctors which I will have to be routinely monitored for my PSA levels for the next year. My therapist advised for me to return back into what I love to do best slowly. I was offered a week worth of work and then a run in Las Vegas in which I am able to sit in one place until the 12th. This will truly be a great way to acclimate to working and gives me the opportunity to wean my way back into the work force at a pace I can take it day by day.Due to all of you surrounding me with continuous love and support I was able to change my test into a testimony and shift life\\'s priorities which are quite different now. Being classified as a survivor supporting the cause of others who have gone through and are presently going through this is my main priority now. I am still attending my support groups and advocating for community support groups to reach the huge gap of men not being educated about prostate cancer and/or men who have cancer who are stuck in a negative space not knowing what resources and supports are available to them for a positive outlook and recovery.Last week after a long interview process I was elected to the board of directors of US Too Organization which is an internationally known organization providing faster and easier access to accurate and objective educational materials and resources to help men and their spouses/partners and families make informed decisions about prostate cancer detection treatment options and related side effects.We all know that knowledge is power. Knowledge begins with awareness and basic information about prostate cancer including prevalence high-risk populations testing diagnosis and treatment. Every man has a responsibility to take control of managing his care to ensure that he’s not over-treated or under-treated. And the information required to effectively manage prostate cancer can be much more extensive than what might be needed for managing many other diseases. In addition to active surveillance or watchful waiting as potential options there are several types of treatments and multiple therapies and combinations available to eliminate or manage the disease. It’s also important to recognize that any treatment will have side effects. The extent to which they are present their duration and overall impact on quality of life will vary for each man.My wife asked for me to share with you that she is humbly grateful for the love and kindness all of you have expressed to her during this challenging time. Your support provided encouragement to keep her lifted in faith to stay strong to help me through the surgery and ongoing recovery process.Thank you to all of you who are definitely a part of saving my life and through your support I will continue this fight and will be able to help save others.With sincere appreciation and loveDerek Wilson\"\"Thank you all!!!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Nadine Ruiz-Carlson 22 months ago Share Hello to everyone near and dear to DerekIn under two weeks 74 people have donated to contribute just shy of an overwhelming $56000! Well over our original goal! Truly a mark of the man! The sincerest gratitude to everyone for your time contributions thoughts and well wishes! Your warmth has been well received! And your support has gone a long way to make a well-deserving man feel really loved.An update on Derek’s health:Last Monday he returned to the doctor for another procedure and a check up. His pathology report was very positive and there was no sign of cancer in the surrounding tissue! Though this news is great he has had a hard week otherwise and is still experiencing quite a lot of pain. There’s been a little bump in his recovery and was hospitalized two days ago due to clotting issues. He is optimistic he will get to go home soon but he will likely be out of work longer than doctors had originally anticipated so we plan to keep his Gofundme campaign up in the meantime.Please continue to keep Derek in your thoughts and prayers and we will keep you updated as we hear from his wife Dawn. Thank you again for your support!Sincerely Jen Jacobs Dawn Wilson Nadine RoselleA note from Derek:\"\"Every one of us has our challenges in life. This diagnosis is one that has touched our lives in a profound way. We have decided to come public with this battle to make sure that friends and family we love who see this will take time out and get themselves tested. Men please get your PSA tested ten years earlier than recommended especially if prostrate cancer runs in your family. My first sign was an elevated PSA screening. Also remember that one of the top 3 cancers for both men and women is colon cancer. Please make sure to get your colonoscopy as early diagnosis is treatable! When I am up and running again soon I plan to join a cancer outreach group to help them spread the word. In attending a support group recently before my surgery I discovered there is a lack of young people and men in these groups that do not get tested. I was one of them until I was diagnosed. I was the youngest in the group I attended. If it were up to me I would have been back out on the road with my touring family already but I was forced to sit down for a few weeks to recover. I have received video messages and notes that are just priceless. Those of you that gave I am grateful and express my deepest and heartfelt thanks however those of you that were \"\"anonymous\"\" you will be found out... :) We have medical benefits to cover my care and have faith we will be okay financially. It is truly appreciated the contributions of all given to this fund and it is our wish that anyone wishing to do more to give to your favorite charity of choice as we are sure that cancer has touched someone else close to you as well. The outpouring of love has us emotionally charged and you just don\\'t know how you have touched our lives. If I can save just one person\\'s life through this then it was worth all this pain. This is my testimony.\"\"Please also see his video update. Derek\\'s Video Update+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Nadine Ruiz-Carlson 23 months ago Share 11 Within two days we are at $27520!

If the biopsy is positive he would begin radiation treatment. And if not that is of course great news and he will be able to focus on recovery!Please continue to keep Derek in your thoughts and prayers during this time and feel free to continue to share the link we are almost at our goal!

Dlouhy lived in Roswell until 1967 and was known in the neighborhood as the boy who sat in trees wearing his Superman outfit. Dlouhy exhibited athletic prowess early on – he was a very fast runner as he was often chased by his older brothers Dave and Darrell.Dlouhy finished elementary school in Grand Forks North Dakota where he enjoyed playing all sports. He even had his Dad build an ice rink in the back yard so he could learn to play hockey. Ultimately he shined in football and basketball. The Dlouhy family moved to Coeur d\\'Alene in 1970 where Duane dominated as an All-State Player for the Vikings in both football and basketball.Dlouhy earned a full-ride scholarship to Boise State where lifelong friendships with teammates and coaches began. His catch on 4th down with 12 seconds remaining enabled Boise State to capture the 1980 I-AA National Championship. Dlouhy was named Honorable Mention All-American in 1981. Dlouhy signed a free agent contract with the Washington Redskins of the NFL. Although the NFL was not Duane\\'s destiny being a Bronco was. After his time with the Redskins Boise State coaches came calling once again. Due to his impressive five-minute mile and athletic skills he was awarded a basketball scholarship. The next season he played football for the Arizona Wrangers in the USFL. He ended his playing career by joining Boise State\\'s football staff as a tight-end coach.When Duane walked into Thiry Chiropractic office and saw Debbie Duke it was love at first sight for both of them. Their courtship only lasted three-months yet their marriage has lasted a lifetime. During their 34-year marriage they welcomed Dustin Drue and Demi to their family. Dustin was a defensive end for University of Montana and Demi played volleyball at Lewis-Clark State College. Drue his daughter gave him his first grandchildren Ellie and Halle Hatfield. Although Dlouhy was an accomplished athlete he considered his greatest accomplishment to be what he created with Debbie.In 1986 Dlouhy left the football field for a position in Utah where he began his 20-year career in the automotive industry. His career took the family to Twin Falls and Idaho Falls where the children were raised on sports road trips and laughter. In early 2007 Dlouhy determined to see his youngest daughter play all her college games relocated to his roots in Coeur d\\'Alene ID where he worked at Pita Pit USA serving as director of construction. Dlouhy was thankful for all Pita Pit gave to him as they added numerous cherished memories and experiences for his family. Dlouhy\\'s lifelong dream of owning a boat was realized a few years ago when he christened the Coeur D\\'louhy. The many days and nights spent on the lake were filled with smiles and laughter enjoying his favorite things family friends and great music.Dlouhy is survived by his mother Ana Mae Dlouhy his brothers David (Ali) Darrel (Val) wife Debbie children Dustin (Meg) Drue (Darrin Hatfield) Demi (Andrew Miller) grandchildren Ellie and Halle Grae \"\"bows and toes\"\". He is preceded in death by his father William Dlouhy and sister-in-law Debbie Sears Dlouhy.This quote found on BroncoCountry.com depicts Dlouhy both on and off the field; \"\"Duane Dlouhy was one of our best players though his stats wouldn\\'t indicate greatness... he was simply reliable and seemed always there when you needed a play\"\".Memorial services will be held at Lake City Church in Coeur d\\'Alene on Friday June 16 at 1 p.m. Family requests lake-day casual attire.In lieu of flowers we encourage all who wish to honor him to donate to the Duane E.

This has been an intense four months for the Dlouhy Family. So much has happened since the day we received Duane’s diagnosis. In a time where we felt so alone and scared everyone stepped up to remind us that we were not.Duane has completed five rounds of chemo five intense radiation treatments and had his rectum and tumor removed. This surgery has left him with a lifelong side effect as he now has a colostomy that is irreversible.He will be in the hospital for 3-6 days depending on how he responds to the surgery and colostomy. So far so good! If everything continues this way Debbie and Duane will head home the week of Christmas to be with their precious Bows and Toes and Ellie Bellie.WHATS NEXT:Because there were more cancerous lymph nodes discovered during the surgery than was originally thought Duane will have a scan on Friday and meet with his oncology team here at the Mayo Clinic to discuss his treatment plan. Now that the tumor in his rectum is gone they can focus all efforts onto the lungs which need the most attention if we are going to win the war. Our current plan is based on where Duane is right now. One thing is for sure this whole cancer game is always changing! When he returns to Idaho he will complete at least three more rounds of chemo possible radiation and then return to the Mayo Clinic in the new year for his first lung surgery. His major tumor is officially not a pain in the ass anymore! ON TO THE LUNGS!!!!OUR CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM:The amount of \"\"thank yous\"\" we have said will never compare to the gratitude we have in our hearts. The support and love around our family has gotten us through all of the dark days. God has blessed us with this championship team of friends and family who will carry Duane to the goal line.Duane has found this quote to be a representation of his journey thus far–“You are stronger than you know more capable than you ever dreamed and you are loved more than you could possibly imagine.”Much love to all!

Not only for the donations but also for the prayers emails texts phone calls  food and the numerous other thoughtful things you all have done. We are truly blessed to have such great friends and family. A little update on Duane; He had his 4th round of IV chemo yesterday.We also sat down with the oncologist and reviewed the results of his recent pet scan. The tumor and lymph nodes have shrunk! Halleluiah this is exactly what we\\'ve been praying for. The not so great news is that he had two cancerous spots in his lungs we now know that there are six. This may mean more complicated surgeries involving his lungs. We will find more out about that soon. We still continue to be very optimistic and feel very blessed by the news of the tumor and lymph nodes. Please continue the prayers for shrinkage and also that we will find a surgeon that will be able to operate. Additionally they are also changing his chemo regiment. The doctors feel that the side effects are becoming pretty harsh on his body so hopefully the change will help. We will be making the trip to the Mayo Clinic as planned and have confidence in receiving their treatment plan ideas once they have examined Duane.

Breast Cancer Awareness should not be just 31 days in the month of October but should be every day of every year.For those of us whose lives have been destroyed by breast cancer it is. 40000 women die every year to breast cancer. This number hasn\\'t changed for years. All the millions of dollars that have been donated to \"\"find a cure\"\" hasn\\'t made a damn bit of difference. I could go into why this is the case but most of you already know. My mission in my life is to try to save as many women\\'s lives as possible. I cannot do this without your help. The Donna Marino Breast Cancer Foundation is a 100% non-profit organization. Every cent that is donated goes to a woman who is battling this horrible disease.

The first day of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Breast Cancer Awareness should not be just 31 days in the month of October but should be every day of every year.For those of us whose lives have been destroyed by breast cancer it is. 40000 women die every year to breast cancer. This number hasn\\'t changed for years. All the millions of dollars that have been donated to \"\"find a cure\"\" hasn\\'t made a damn bit of difference. I could go into why this is the case but most of you already know. My mission in my life is to try to save as many women\\'s lives as possible. I cannot do this without your help. The Donna Marino Breast Cancer Foundation is a 100% non-profit organization. Every cent that is donated goes to a woman who is battling this horrible disease.

       " 'Update 1 Posted by Charlicia Lewis 34 months ago Share Hello family friends & supporters: I would like to thank you all for the prayers encouraging words and support. I would like to update you all on the status of my fight with breast cancer. On March 16 was my last chemotherapy treatment thank God!!! Chemo treatment was a struggle however; I got through it & I did it. A few weeks afterwards on April 8 I had a double mastectomy & reconstruction surgery. It was a long surgery but everything went well. I’m currently recovering and taking it easy and on day at a time. Reconstruction surgery is a process; therefore I’ll be having surgery again in a couple of months. Please continue to keep me in you all prayers. Prior to having surgery doctors ran test. Come to find out there were no cancer cells within my right breast or lymph nodes. To God be the glory I am cancer free. I know if it wasn’t for God and my faith in him none of this would have been possible to get through. This will be my testimony and I just hope and pray that by sharing my journey and story that I’ll help someone else with theirs. I am selling my no cancer zone #doitforlisa shirts still if anyone wants to support and purchase one. Again I thank you all & continue to pray for me and I’ll continue to keep you all posted. Thanks Charlicia (Lisa)+ Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 601 total shares',\n",

Please give if you can. The plan is for Dom and Cass to complete this treatment in 100 days. Our donations will assist during that time. Also thoughts and prayers to transplant acceptance and success.ThanksCraig+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Craig Merrilees 3 months ago Share Hello everyone~This is Cassandra hoping this email makes it to you. (Not really knowing my way around this site.)I've thought of all of you often and with so much gratefulness and fullness of heart. I've wanted to sit down and write a thank you note to each of you some I have been able to and with others it will happen. It's actually something we look forward to. I've kind of been waiting to get to this next step that would not be possible without all of your help to update and send thanks.Transplant process starts one week from today. Actual transplant is November 28. It has been a long road to get here. It will yet be a long road ahead.We have driven from our home to Sacramento and back again (2 hours each way) about a dozen times every month for seven months now.It will be strange to live in a new city for 3 months or so but we're all set now. We're really hoping Dom responds well to transplant and we can be on to the recovery process. The financial help we have received blows my mind. I know it makes Dominic emotional too. It is such a humbling thing to receive. It has been a struggle for Dominic to not work these past 7 months and a struggle for me to hold it all together. Being cared for financially has eased the struggle a bit for us.More than that it has given me strength when times have felt really low to know that people care about us. Some people we've never even met so it's nothing I have done to earn this favor but it's the generosity of complete strangers. Friends of friends and family have offered to us so much. It's something I've thought of often throughout this process. The goodness and kindness of people. We know not everyone has been in a place to share financially and bask in the love and support of even a kind or encouraging word. Know that we are so very thankful. We look forward to thanking as many of you face to face as possible. We look forward to paying it forward.With so much loveCassandra and Dominic+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Craig Merrilees 8 months ago Share 22 Cass funning and Dom smiling sans hair.+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Craig Merrilees 8 months ago Share Here's a photo from the first round of Chemo.

       " \"Update 11 Posted by Alex Rabbitt 8 months ago Share 33 Hello wonderful people. I wanted to write an update to let you all know our latest news….Mike is doing SSSOOOOOOOOOO WELL! We have certainly had a few scares along the way the last 6 months but generally now he is flying from strength to strength! So many good things have happened I don’t even know where to start…We had Mike’s 1 year follow-up back in Philadelphia in June and Mike is still in complete remission! This is BIG news. To hit the 1 year marker is very significant post CAR T Cell treatment and we have absolutely smashed it! We still have some milestones to go (as always) but I cannot begin to describe the relief at getting to this one. HUUUUUUAGE!! To celebrate on our way home from Heathrow Airport we picked up the newest addition to the Brandon household: Pablo Alan ‘Escobar’ Brandon. I have found another love! He is a lot of work but a true treasure. We got our dog!I can’t believe we have made it. Making that video little over a year ago I was broken. I did have some hope but really I felt like I was just desperately grasping at straws. There were so many hurdles to overcome let alone the teeny matter of making nearly half a million pounds! The odds were stacked against us but it all blooming worked! To be writing these words to you I am already welling up. I am still in shock even a year on. I have my husband back…. I have my life back …. I couldn’t have done it without you!To my brilliant friends who worked tirelessly to start our campaign my family for supporting me 100% every single step of the way Dr Frey + Penn Medicine for managing our America medical rollercoasters Professor Marks and Bristol Haematology Oncology Unit for managing all our UK medical rollercoasters (Mike loved to be the drama queen :) ) and to each one of you who donated to our desperate plea. We have been shown the utmost generosity kindness care and love beyond any expectation and I thank you all from the bottom of my bulging heart.Going through this experience does scar you a little death always sits on your shoulder hanging around taunting heartlessly with your thoughts. When that happens I take a breath and remember the chance you all gave us and with the power of that positivity I feel determined to enjoy each day. With each week that passes we both feel a little stronger and more relaxed. It is so utterly heart-warming to see Mike start to really live life again. The beauty of normality.This last few months after being so isolated and wrapped in cotton wool for so long we have done so many incredible things. We had our first holiday abroad in over 3 years we climbed a mountain we cycled 42km around a lake (nearly killed us :) ) Mike got his first promotion we’ve had loads of quality friends and family time. Mike went to his first cricket match and first gig he got on his first bus had his first round of baby vaccinations had his first almost normal full blood count ate his first runny egg and cleared up his first of many dog poos! What a completely all encompassing and joyful 2017!!!You really do learn to find a renewed appreciation of the smaller things. When he was going through the ‘cytokine storm’ with the treatment last summer he couldn't lie flat for 6 weeks. Now seeing him sleep comfortably and peacefully each morning and night is the most heartwarming of all.Miracles do happen … they happen because of people like youWith love and all the gratitude in the worldKate BrandonxxxPS All donations through this page go straight to the Above and Beyond Charity helping people like Mike! xOur latest edition....Our 1st holiday we walked 20km a day!Bit of boule in Westbury On Trym + Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Alex Rabbitt 16 months ago Share Hello wonderful 22824 people who helped save Mike!Just wanted to write to say he is doing so so well! Day to day life is an absolute joy I cannot begin to list the things that we are both so grateful for. We are at hospital less and less and this weeks big news is - Mike has just done his first few half days at work. BOOM!We are hosting our first fundraising event to say thank you to Mike’s Haematology & Oncology Centre in Bristol. Mike was by no means a ‘perfect patient’ earlier this year: he threw every complication under the sun at them but they kept him alive and got him to America. We are raising money for the hospital to place in a fund that will help families involved in CAR T-Cell therapy once it becomes available in the UK in the future.https://www.gofundme.com/donate4tcellsWe also wanted a chance to say thank you to some of you that supported our campaign. After all you made this happen! All proceeds from the day will be going to Above and Beyond and the Penny Brohn Cancer Care Centre who are kindly hosting the event.Our ‘Tea Cell Party’ will be on November 19th at Penny Brohn Pill 1pm-5pm. It will be a fundraising day filled with tea cake yoga massage clothing craft and jewellery stalls. No entrance fee just donate what you can on the day.

Prior to starting the therapy Mike’s bone marrow was almost completely made up of leukaemia cells 28 days later there were none.The part played in this by the whole team at Penn Medicine especially all on Rhoads 7 cannot be over-emphasised. We have received kindness care and compassion beyond any expectation.This is a great first step showing that the T-Cell therapy is doing exactly what we hoped it would. We still have quite some distance to go in our journey but we are currently filled with huge relief to have cleared such an enormous hurdle.We thank each and every one of you for getting us here.

We are hopeful and moving toward an upswing as we prepare for pre-operative testing next week. The new surgery date is December 13th on which the right side mastectomy and bi-lateral reconstruction will be completed. Though we are moving toward the final stretch there are still several months of healing check ups drains tubes and scares to come.

The end point is to be a survivor but what path gets you there with the least pain and suffering. This month my mother has decided to go ahead with reconstruction but to also remove the other breast and complete the full mastectomy. Things will move forward soon and the recovery will be long. Please keep us in your thoughts. We are still battling to get costs covered and with the decision to do preventative measures it is an uphill battle to cover the costs for her wishes. It is a shame that what may save your life comes at such a high cost. Please donate anything you can to our fund and thank you for your support. New little hairs!+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by Barbara Gracey 56 months ago Share Greetings from the Moore family!I'd like to take some time and thank everyone for you're donations prayers and support. They have been invaluable in this time and continue to be a major source of strength. The second set of chemotherapy treatments started out very painful. My mom stayed in bed for 3 days straight in too much pain to walk. The active drug Taxol causes a great deal of pain and swelling in the muscles and joins as well as skin color changes. It is now being managed with steroids and Claritin to keep the side effects at bay. She still has trouble walking around after the treatments but at least is able to find some relief with time. Some good news came our way recently; there will be no need for radiation after the last chemotherapy treatment. After about a month a half of recovery the reconstruction surgery will be performed. We have just two more Taxol treatments left; July 23rd marks the last chemotherapy treatment. We are still handling the turbulence from an ill loved one but at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel. My mom is in good spirits and I hope that the next few months are easier. Please continue to keep us in your thoughts. As always donations prayers and your love are welcome and needed. Mom after leaving Chemo 6. Positive. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

So if you were unsure about coming please know that a donation on this page here is the safest play to make a difference and not have to stand in line amongst all those others who love these people.

       " 'Update 4 Posted by Brent Holcombe 6 months ago Share 11 Hey everyone! I\\'d like to take a minute and update you all. We took Dylan to the Autism Treatment Center of America (ATCA) 2 weeks ago (7/31 - 8/4) and it was a phenomenal life-changing experience!Over the course of the 5 days Dylan improved in many areas. Regarding verbal communication he was able to communicate around 25 words! I still get a little emotional just thinking about it two weeks later. Additionally he showed improvements with his non-verbal communication interactive attention span and flexibility (i.e. sense of spontaneity less rigidity in situations that aren\\'t predictable).Since returning home we\\'ve been doing our best to continue helping Dylan progress. As you could imagine it\\'s been a bit harder with the transition process after leaving the ATCA which in my opinion is the optimal environment. But now that we know what is possible we\\'ll do whatever it takes to \"get the job done\" at home.Currently my wife and I are developing Dylan\\'s home-based Son-Rise Program. A significant part of any Son-Rise Program is the reliance and utilization of Volunteers. If you or someone you know live in the Clemson/Pendleton/Anderson SC area and would like to know more about volunteering send my wife Sara an email at sarabell79@mac.com for details. We think it\\'s a wonderful opportunity not only because it\\'ll help our special guy but also with the training we\\'ll be providing the volunteers in areas of personal and professional development.In the future we\\'d be absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to take Dylan back to the ATCA considering how well everything went a few weeks ago! My hope is that we\\'ll be able to have Dylan spend time with those great people at the ATCA at least once every 18-24 months in order to get optimal feedback along with updated strategies/techniques for his current stage of development. So with that being said we\\'ll continue to keep his GoFundMe campaign active for those of you who feel generous enough contribute. Before I finish the update I\\'d like to thank each and everyone of you who contributed to Dylan\\'s GoFundMe. We\\'re truly blessed to have you wonderful folks in our lives! I\\'ll be sure to keep you all posted on Dylan\\'s progress. I\\'ll leave you all with one of my favorite quotes by the late Zig Ziglar. \"You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.\" Much love and have a great day!!! ~BrentIn the playroom!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Brent Holcombe 14 months ago Share I\\'d like to take a moment and collectively thank everyone who has shared and/or donated to Dylan\\'s campaign.

We still have some work to do in order to reach our goal but I have no doubt we\\'ll be successful! No amount is too small and every little bit helps.

And had some lovely visitors! They have managed my pain but plan to change some more meds around a little depending on how night goes. I\\'m feeling pretty good about the direction they are moving with my meds. So hopefully they get it all figured out soon and I\\'m home again with my family. Some have been wondering where I am with treatment. So here is all I know.... They still are unsure where my cancer is coming from they do know it has spread.to my lymph nodes in abdomen which is what is causing the intense pain ( they are so large they are pressing on other organs and and on back causing a lot of my pain) the pathology came back saying the origin is still unknown but could possibly be of gylnological origin (but won\\'t know for sure without more tests) so they have ordered a PET scan for Thursday and my oncologist has also sent off samples to a cancer I.d. typing center to hopefully get more answers we need to move forward with treatment. There is also a very likely chance I will be going to either Nashville or Louisville (if not a few other) university hospitals to get more opinions. but again is all depending on results. Results typically take about two weeks to get back but with the holidays I hope it doesn\\'t throw it off too much more.Please keep prayers and well wishes coming.

       " '\"Update 4 Posted by Dena Toma 7 months ago Share A year ago today I was diagnosed with cancer. I remember walking into the Drs office with Michelle and Ashlie already knowing it was a positive diagnosis. (I kind of got it out of the nurse that called me to come in.) It was weird because I didn\\'t really feel anything at that moment. I didn\\'t feel anything walking into that office or sitting down in the special room or anything about an hour in of that Dr telling me the details of what I had. At about hour two and hearing about the surgery options and having to have chemo and radiation and genetic testing - did I about stop breathing. I started sobbing. Then told him to finish. I felt like I couldn\\'t breathe anymore and wanted to run away. I wanted a \"\"do over\"\" at what ever it was that I did wrong that caused me to have this disease. I went home and cried and cried and begged God to just help me out and to see what the lesson he was showing me is. What do I need to gain to pass on and to teach and learn. I\\'ve tried in the last year to help others. Be kind. Love more. Stress less. Be vulnerable. Let others help. Eat better. Live better. Not be so hard on myself. And to laugh as much as possible.

       " 'Update 1 Posted by Simone Wood 8 months ago Share Hello Everyone!As you all know I started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to help support our dear friend Elizabeth who was diagnosed with AML earlier this year. To date the campaign has raised $22000!After talking with Elizabeth we decided with an enormous amount of help from Eric Kearney an attorney and friend to Elizabeth to set up a trust. This will protect and preserve the funds raised so that they can be managed and used for Elizabeth’s sole benefit. The Trust that I established with Eric’s help is named the “Elizabeth Maxon Third Party Special Needs Trust.” It is an Irrevocable Special Needs Trust that holds the funds that have been donated to date along with any future donations raised through this site or direct contributions to the trust. By setting up the Trust the goal is that the money that everyone generously donated will be used just for the things that Elizabeth needs and wants without limiting her ability to access help through various state and federal programs. Any funds that Elizabeth doesn’t need will be donated to the OHSU Foundation with funds earmarked for Leukemia research. I have initiated a transfer of the funds into the Trust which means that donations should be possible again shortly and I can begin to make sure Elizabeth has the support and funds she needs going forward in her treatment. If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me. Eric is also open to fielding any questions you have for him about the trust.Thank you all for your continued support and love of Elizabeth. I’m immensely grateful that the campaign has done so well thus far and I hope that with the trust in place we can further insure Elizabeth’s security care and quality of life going forward.LoveSimone+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

We have called her nurse and she has agreed that the pain is most likely a cramp since it doesn\\'t hurt with every breath and based on her getting winded easier and her skin being pale she is probably in need of blood. She has an appt in the morning so we will know for sure when they check her labs. She is still running a low grade temp (100.2) no fever!!! Please pray it doesn\\'t go any higher! Despite all this she is still smiling! She is SO tough! Please pray for a good report tomorrow and an easy port access with NO fear or tears. I will be taking Abby to her appt by myself tomorrow since daddy and nana have to work. Please pray for me to be able to stay strong for Abby and to be what she needs tomorrow for her to stay strong.

       " '\"Update 13 Posted by Gene Baker 20 months ago Share Update on Lisa\\'s progress...... Three steps forward four steps back..... :(Lisa has been having a rough time with her surgical incision staying closed after a double mastectomy two months ago. One side keeps giving her problems requiring more stitches or extra fluid draining procedures log after the initial drains were removed.Then radiation began which is set to last every day for 5 weeks.....the process requires holding your hands above your head for about 30-45 minutes straight. This led to her incision opening up again which generates more fluid to build up and it stops her radiation process until shes healed AGAIN!! So the doctor stitched her back up but she still has to go in to have fluid drained as it builds.Well Tuesday morning while doc was draining her fluids with a needle and syringe they popped her Expander which led to saline spilling out inside of her. Due to this she now has to go thru mastectomy surgery all over AGAIN and this delays her healing time by at least an extra two months three steps forward found steps back....... Sad part is she has now been down and out for almost a full year come September 15th...... Going onto Cobra insurance since shes been out of work so long our rates skyrocketed to over $1500 a month!!! and they wont let us drop myself to save half of that $$$ till November...... and all delays only keep the two of us apart longer which is mentally draining on us both. I can\\'t earn a full income due to traveling and she\\'s coming closer to the end of her disability..... I\\'m selling off anything that\\'s not bolted down.Meanwhile we still have to finish a home remodel and get our home listed for sale. Paying a mortgage in CA plus house rent in North Carolina constantly having to put Mozart in a kennel why I travel while he is also dealing with a cancer and set for another round of surgery himself....... Just makes one want to scream cry and say enough already. So my beard will continue to grow until Lisa is cancer free and boy am I looking forward to the day of shaving it off.I hate asking for support when we can do ok \"\"IF\"\" I can stay in one state and start working full time. But things are going to get rough sooner then later so just tightening the belt to manage the journey.Seeing Lisa go thru this and what it does to her physically to emotionally is sheer heart wrenching. Meanwhile my mom is still hanging in there with extra time being added to her life after given only weeks to live with a severe case of ovarian cancer I\\'ve gotten to see her a few times since we got the word and she\\'s managing well with lots of friend to family support to make her final days as comfortable as possible.Life\\'s too short and time too precious hugs to all wives moms pets and your better half. Never give up hope faith and support for those in need. Live each day as if it could be your last. Meanwhile giving it all I got and thank you all for your help kind words of support and much more...... Even writing this stuff makes me shed a tear thinking all we have been thru and what we still have left to endure.....There\\'s an end to this somewhere........ Feeling Severely Humbled......PS Lisa needs help daily but is too proud to ask but she will thankfully accept anyone that just comes and helps. Dishes mow the lawn as its about three feet tall now...... vacuum the house throw some clothes in the laundry etc... all these things she cannot do SHE/WE NEED YOUR HELP! Message her and don\\'t take no for an answer please! + Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Gene Baker 22 months ago Share Cant thank you all enough for sharing and helping us reach our goal. Don\\'t stop please! Updates! Lisa has her drains removed surgery went well. BUT they did find a few remaining cancer cells with clear margins. Due to this they can only call this an 80% success rate which they do not feel comfortable with so they want to extend chemo for an additional 6 months or oral chemo which may buy her another 10% at best plus remove her ovaries to reduce any cancer return.Remember Lisa is a Triple Negative cancer type which is extremely hard to battle as it doesn\\'t respond well to most drugs.Not exactly sure what this all means but I assume its going to drag out the procedures and delay her and I from living together 24/7..... Nothing worse then not being able to be there for the love of your life when needed most while also dealing with ovarian cancer taking its toll on my mom with the clock ticking plus glaucoma taking my dogs eye just 2 weeks ago.All the same we are in good spirits trying not to let these things change our daily life but its just a long road......... These past 2 weeks have been my first trip back to CA but I also have to return to NC come this Saturday so the time was short and sweet. Many more to come before this battle is over so we thank everyone form the bottom of our heart for your support financially emotionally and spiritually.We thank you all+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Gene Baker 22 months ago Share 11 Getting everyone an official update. Past few months have been brutal on the emotions. Lisa had a double mastectomy less then 2 weeks ago with radiation to start in roughly a month form now. Meanwhile my mom has been given only weeks to live with a bad case of Ovarian cancer then our dog Mozart (my sole roommate here in North Carolina) developed Glaucoma and just had his right eye removed today! So my emotions are at an all time peak making one feel rather helpless except for doing what we can to care for our loved ones best we can and just pray wait pray some more......due diligence....Lisa being 2600+ miles away and in a lot of pain from surgery is enough to make any husband bow ones head. As it is I am only working part time due to my priorities still waiting for me in California. But living in two states does not come easy so I am playing a delicate balancing game of finances to emotions. Our insurance is getting ready to bite us back with rates about 5x more then we are use to paying. Working helps me escape emotionally and helps keep bills taken care of to a degree so a HUGE THANK YOU to all who have supported and or continue to support our fight. Lisa is also going to be out of work for a good few more months or better and a full recovery looking like March 2017 before we can create a call for celebration. I just keep saying \"\"This all will pass\"\" and brighter days what seems to be a long way down the road from today...... So all support is some added brightness to our day and truly helps keep a roof over our heads and medical support when needed.My California friends I will see you soon as I return May 1-14th three MGB gigs booked so catch us while were still around. But best I get to see Lisa and do what I can to help her in the short time I return.....Love you all give your wife mom and pet a big hug today.Gene Baker+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Gene Baker 25 months ago Share Once again they have stopped Lisa\\'s chemo as her white count has fallen too low. But tomorrow is our #9 wedding anniversary and hopefullywe\\'ll find something to keep her smiling and comfortable.

The money you\\'ve helped raise has contributed towards the costs of gas and other travel expenses to NYC for treatment as well as many other unforeseen costs that have come up the past few months as Emily has taken leave from work during the course of her treatment. Emily has just finished another round of chemo therapy this week and is currently at Sloan following up with her doctor. It\\'s likely she\\'ll have to undergo another blood transfusion just before Christmas. She continues to be in good spirits and I know that she is feeling all of the prayers and energy that is being sent her way.

       " \"Update 2 Posted by Stephanie Dunn 12 months ago Share 11 I found out on a Friday in July during my lunch break that I had cancer. When I came back to work that day my co-worker (and good friend) asked me what was wrong. I hesitated to tell her. I finally did tell her and said I wasn’t going to tell anyone else at work. She said “Emily everyone is just going to want to love you. Let them”. When I found out about the GoFundMe my sister started for me I was initially filled with embarrassment then the words of my co-worker came back to me. Although it is difficult for me to accept my friend was right everyone just wants to love me. I wish I could fully convey to you all how much each donation means to me. I feel blessed and humbled beyond belief. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.I also want to update you all on how I am doing. I had a bi-lateral mastectomy last week along with the removal of 19 axillary lymph nodes. My surgeon told me that only 3 of the lymph nodes she removed still had cancer present and my largest tumor (7 cm) was almost non-existent. She said because the chemotherapy worked so well my prognosis is very good. Because I have an aggressive fast growing form of breast cancer it most often recurs within the first two years after diagnosis. So if I can make it 2 years without a recurrence my odds of living a long life are very good! In about 3 weeks I will start my daily radiation treatments. I am looking forward to finishing radiation and going on with my “normal” life. Although the last 7 months have been extremely difficult both physically and emotionally I would do all of it a hundred times more if it means that Hope will always have a mom. Thank you again to everyone who has cared for me in one or another. I am filled with gratitude and will do whatever I can to pay it forward.Emily+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Stephanie Dunn 13 months ago Share 22 I am so grateful for the generosity that has been shown by everyone. I have friends from high school who have donated friends of Hope's Family friends from out time in St. Louis and every thing in between. Each time I see a donation come in or receive a kind text of support I am deeply thankful. This has also been a wonderful lessen of giving for my children. Levi cannot believe how many Pokemon cards people could have bought but instead have donated their money to his auntie. Naomi has also been touched by your generosity. She told me that she wants to be like the lady in the bible (Mathew 12) who gave all that she had. In Naomi's case that is $4.63. Again I thank you for sharing with Emily and forgoing the Pokemon cards you could have bought instead.. I know Emily will be deeply thankful and it will lighten her load. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 1 Posted by Lindsey Chism 26 months ago Share 11 \"\"It\\'s cancer\"\" the words have recently changed the landscape of our lives. I believe FULLY in the power of prayer and also the wisdom of modern medicine but this is something no one is prepared for or expects to hear. Here is a starting place. A place where we can gather encourage share and learn. My sweet sister Emily has recently begun a battle for her health. She will win. She has invited you into her journey and this is where we start. The cancer is called Mucinous Carcinoma and typically is very treatable and non aggressive. It begins in the milk duct and usually is very contained. Further testing on the biopsy has shown that the tumor is in fact aggressive so the only way to combat is with 18 weeks of chemo followed by surgery (lumpectomy as of right now unless her genetic test comes back positive when she will likely opt for a full mastectomy and reconstruction) then radiation. This makes Emily an anomaly on top of an anomaly. She\\'s 30 and most people who are diagnosed are over 50 and have gone through menopause. Most of these cases are just treated by only surgery and radiation. In true Emily style she has held her head high and tackled this news with much grace and dignity though it has been a lot to process. Just navigating the insurance system has been a full time job. (Oh and did i mention that she\\'s still going to work at her two jobs throughout this whole thing? Even on the fringes of the flu that recently struck their house I watched her carefully pack up the car and head to a home visit when it was difficult to even stand) this kind of quiet strength bodes well for her ability to kick cancers BUTT!The next step: She\\'ll be waiting for about 10 more days for the genetic test results and the 2nd round of lab tests (performed by a different lab) on her tumor. Her case is getting much attention from many doctors because it doesn\\'t fit ANY mold. She is also going for an echocardiogram next week to be sure her heart is strong enough to endure the harsh effects of chemo. Her next appt with her oncologist will be December 29th which is when you can expect a new update here. After this meeting she will have a surgically placed port for her chemo treatments which will be given every 3 weeks. Surgery will come next then radiation. So many people have given generously already and I\\'m humbled to see how many lives Emily has touched. (But not so surprised because let\\'s face it she\\'s one of the most remarkable women I have ever met) Some of you have reached out by phone text etc to share info offer prayer scripture and we feel completely wrapped in your love. Thank you so very much for taking time to cheer on our girl. Keep it coming! This will be a very long process and you all mean so much to her. One specific way you can pray is for family. She\\'s been told that chemo has the potential to leave her sterile and unable to have more children. Pray that this is NOT the case and that she will be able to have more babies after this is all well behind her.

On February 25th Emma took a 3rd place medal at the Junior Olympics!! She wasn\\'t sure she would ever compete again and she proved herself wrong! She\\'s coming back!On May 4th just 3 days after her 15th birthday she will be seeing her Endocrinologist at Phoenix Children\\'s Hospital. June 13th Emma and her mom Robin will fly to Houston for appointments at MD Anderson Hospital. She will have an array of tests which will include blood work ultrasound and a full body scan so they can determine course of treatment. There is a possibility she will be immediately admitted to start the radioactive iodine. There is a chance that per the scan they may opt to not dose her with the RI but they told Robin based on the information they already have from pathology they feel 75% sure they WILL be doing it. That\\'s a pretty good chance without even doing the scan yet. The specialists are being optimistic. This being said she will then have a post treatment scan on June 19th and then they can travel home with hopes the treatment is working!!The next time they board a flight will be MUCH more fun for Emma! She was granted a wish from Make A Wish Foundation - and we all know what Emma loves most the water! On July 7th they will embark on a 7 night Caribbean cruise. Emma is beyond excited to take her family on this fabulous trip. They have some fun adventures planned in Honduras Belize Costa Maya and Cozumel. The Warner\\'s deserve this amazing trip! Thank you to Make A Wish!As for now Emma is back to training as much as she can with physical therapy as needed for her left arm. She has some upcoming swim meets that they are very anxious to watch as the pool is Emma\\'s happy place!Please pray for our sweet strong girl! There\\'s not much that can keep her down.

Our Supergirl! + Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Stephanie Bloniarz 14 months ago Share Thank you for your continued support and prayers for sweet Emma! After a long 8 hour surgery the surgeon\\'s are happy with how things went. They did not remove all of the cancer they removed what they intended as well as more than expected. They had to work around nerves on both sides of her vocal cords both sides of her neck her chest and dissected her left shoulder. The focus had always been the left side of her neck but spent more time on the right this time. They\\'ve had a couple of rough days. She has been dealing with LOTS of pain high blood pressure low calcium and depression. She will remain in the hospital for another night she\\'s had to have several chest x-rays and a CT scan this morning because she has developed some air pockets in her lungs and neck. They are hoping for improvement throughout the day! There are still spots on her lungs that they hope to target with radioactive iodine. The hope was to get the largest areas of cancer out so the RI would kill the smaller stuff. They will continue to monitor her closely today and tonight and hopefully the chest x-ray that will be done later today will show improvements and they can wean her off of the IV pain meds - if all that happens by tomorrow she will be released! (Let\\'s pray hard for this!!) They will remain in their hotel room until Wednesday morning and hope to fly home that day. Emma is a warrior! A hero no doubt! She has experienced more pain than she ever thought possible. Please continue to encourage and pray for Emma Robin and Steve - they haven\\'t had a whole lot of sleep and they are dealing with so many unexpected things. She is excited for tonight... her Youth group is having a Christmas party and they are going to Skype her in so she can be \"\"with them\"\" and pick out her White Elephant gift! She has definitely felt the love encouragement and prayers everyone has been sending. Thank you so much!

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Erica Mirra 8 months ago Share Emily's PET scan from the end of May came back clear and she was able to get her stent removed after that. Since having the stent removed her cough has subsided a lot. She does still have a slight cough at times so it is possible that the Bleomycin (one of the chemo drugs) already had some effect on her lungs. Since the PET scan had a positive result they were able to stop the Bleomycin as part of her chemo. Since the drugs are so strong and can remain in your body for a while even after they stop they will have to wait to determine if the Bleomycin has affected her lungs long term or if it will go away once the drug is completely out of her body. She recently had an echocardiogram and should get the results of that back today. She is still unable to go back to work due to her counts continuing to get extremely low in between chemo treatments.+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Erica Mirra 11 months ago Share Emily told me that they are wanting to do the first chemo treatment tonight while she's still at CTCA in Philadelphia.

Thank you to those that have read about my life and the struggles I carry. This page was created so I can hopefully freeze my eggs. I find it pretty insane that insurance doesn\\'t cover it! Most likely any woman who wants to or has to freeze their eggs does it because they cannot get pregnant on their own infertility time clock because of an early diagnosis to some illness or disease that will effect them from keeping their eggs. It\\'s a proven fact that the government wants people to have children and get married but for those who have to go through so much in order to have a baby deserve insurance. After the recession in 2008 times got tough for everyone but it hit my generation the hardest. Unemployment sky rocketed. I have been employed since I could legally work at the age of 15. I had restrictions and labor laws as a minor but worked as many hours possible. I lucked out and always had a pretty decent job for my age. I started working as a busser for a restaurant in Branford CT with my best friend who was a little older and was a waitress. Being 15 years old with a job I thought it was the best thing ever and fell in love with working. I\\'ve always wanted more I come from a single mom who raised 3 children on her own with a nice house and she worked her butt off so we could have more out of life than off a single mothers salary. Although she has a great career the money doesn\\'t go far when you\\'re taking care of 3 kids paying a mortgage utilities for all of our benefits (insurance). My mother got nothing when she was a kid I love my grandmother who passed away a couple years back but she would barely buy her 5 children (all females) my aunts who I love dearly anything. For the most part the oldest had to pass her clothes down some of them made their own prom dresses. My grandfather was an amazing guy as well but was just as cheap when it came down to things. They believed in saving and only bought literally what was necessary. My mom didn\\'t want us to have a life like that she spoiled us as much as possible and took us on a couple vacations every year. I grew up by a single mom who gave her life away to her children. She did everything for us and I wouldn\\'t know what to do without her but because of you mom I had a strong work ethic and I strived for the most. I was making $300-500 - week as a 15 year old and I didn\\'t have any bills then imagine the excitement. The bad part about me always being happy and living life to its fullest was I didn\\'t have a care in the world to save all I wanted to do was go away with my friends shop shop & spend. I enjoyed every minute of it. As I got a little older at 17 years old I was working for Verizon Wireless and was making even more and I worked there for about 5 years... Anyways I love working I always have there\\'s no better feeling than being able to support yourself and have whatever you want for the most part. I have endometriosis now and I can\\'t have the jobs I want I don\\'t wake up in the morning peacefully I wake up every morning to excruciating pain. The second I wake up I take my meds and it takes 1-3 hours before I\\'m able to actually get up comfortably. The days I don\\'t have a choice like an early morning doctors appointment it sucks and I literally have to drag myself out the door. I\\'m sorry for those who have to deal with this besides myself. A lot of women have endometriosis and some have it really bad. I was always one to enjoy my day I never wanted to be in the house I always wanted to be doing something... If I wasn\\'t working I would be out with my friends or at the gym or shopping and my last resort was always to be home. Now I don\\'t leave my house unless it\\'s for work or for a special occasion. I\\'m always looking for a new series to watch on Netflix. I hate the person I have become I hate having to deal with this. As much as I love working I dread going but once I\\'m working I get to forget about my life and all my problems. It\\'s nice it\\'s almost like working is an escape from reality. I also know that even though I\\'m in a lot of pain there are people out there with far more problems so I also feel like crap. Some people don\\'t have 2 legs to walk on some people are paralyzed many children are suffering/battling cancer and adults. Sometimes I feel like I should never complain because as long as you have pain you know you\\'re alive. My life isn\\'t at risk and I\\'m blessed for that. So for those who don\\'t know what endometriosis is other than a description on the Internet it has taken my life over. Again this post is probably all over the place.. One subject to the next.. Purely just venting but wanted to extend a huge thank you to those who have reached out and given me moral support thank you for those who mailed me checks thank you to those who have donated on gofundme and thank you for caring and sharing my post. Thanks for supporting me and having my back. I will always have your backs and I hope one day I can return the favor for you ! ??????????+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I just seem to be a bit more tired than usual. At some point in the process they will do another biopsy to see how much is still in the bone and the lymph system.

       " '\"Update 2 Posted by Layne Woodward 12 months ago Share My apologies as we are long overdue for an update on Erica and her battle! Here is a recap from Erica and what has happened over the past couple of months. \"\"More results came back after lots of testing this type of invasive ductal carcinoma is called triple negative breast cancer. This is a \"\"bad and aggressive cancer\"\" but fortunately it was caught early and is considered treatable if it responds well to chemo. We also found out that none of this is attributed to genetics which gives us no real explanation for this cancer. I am grateful for Mackenzie that it\\'s not highly likely to be passed on to her. I just had a medi port placed in December and I have just finished my first round of chemo! Phew! I will begin another treatment that is given weekly for the next 12 weeks. Imaging has been done to see how well the first chemo worked and some of the tumors have already shrunk! Excellent news! However one has not so the oncologist added an additional chemotherapy to help increase the chances of a cure. Once the 12 weeks are completed I will then have surgery in Boston which will add an additional 6 + weeks of recovery before returning to work\"\" Erica has been out of work through all of this as it\\'s been extremely tough on her body. Thus putting her at high risk for illness. Her immune system is very vulnerable at this time and she has been very fatigued and has not felt well. The outpouring of love and support has been incredible and she is so grateful to everyone through all of this.

Thanks ??+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Erika Carson 10 months ago Share 11 Hi everyone! Quick update yesterday I went to the doctor for a biopsy for another type of cancer. The doctor said the abnormality could be solely caused by the chemotherapy treatment itself which puts my heart at somewhat of an ease but nevertheless I am awaiting those results quite anxiously. Fingers crossed! I started my third round of chemo treatment this last Friday - I felt a lot better in comparison since the Bleomycin was removed from the chemo regimen.. but I still got my butt kicked a bit towards the end of the weekend. It seems the side effects aren't happening for a few days now instead of the day of chemo.. which is a little rough cause I go from feeling pretty great to being completely run down 3 or 4 days later. It's all a learning process and a humbling experience. I am just so thankful to be alive and breathing and bombarded with reasons to keep smiling. I am also super thankful to have connected with some really amazing women going through their own cancer journeys experiences being able to support and understand one another is absolutely amazing. My family friends people connected to them and even strangers have gone above and beyond for me in this time and it is just amazing. My doTERRA team I belong to has given me a sense or purpose and direction as well it's amazing to have that support and something to keep me busy while I am on disability. There is so much life and love to look forward to. I truly appreciate you all. Thank you for following my story and supporting me on so many levels. Love you all!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Erika Carson 10 months ago Share 22 Removed bleomycin from my chemo regimen because I have had an almost complete metabolic response from my treatment. Now doing avd instead of abvd for the remaining 4 months of treatment. Regardless of having to continue treatments this means the I am almost completely cancer free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU GUYS I am so lucky in so many ways. My journey has been so much more positive than I think anyone expected and I 100% know it was because of the love and support I have continually received. Mind set and life choices are everything.. 80% thc 20% cbd coconut oil capsules and DoTERRA essential oils for symptom management.... reality is though that there are no guarantees still - once in remission and off of chemotherapy this journey will continue for years of my life but right now only two months into treatment the mass is no longer a mass!!!!!

       " \"Update 2 Posted by Jamie Finger 9 months ago Share 11 Erin strong!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Jamie Finger 9 months ago Share First allow me apologize for the significant delay in updating this campaign. It has been a whirlwind seven months since sweet Erin's diagnosis and although it's been difficult I am happy to report things are looking up. RecentlyErin and our family was given the joyful news that she is in remission. For those of you like me who aren't sure what this means in terms of pediatric cancer it simply means Erin's body is no longer producing new cancer cells. This news was as an answered prayer since Erin did not enter remission after her first twenty nine days of treatment as expected. Erin was considered high risk and had she not entered into remission a bone marrow transplant was the next step in her treatment plan. To say that the news of remission was a relief is an understatement. However Erin will continue to receive chemotherapy as is the treatment plan until the summer of 2018. I know I speak for myself and our entire family when I say I am profoundly humbled and eternally grateful for the overwhelming response to this campaign. Every donation from family friends and total strangers is appreciated more then you know. My goal was initially to raise $5000.00 to alleviate at least some of the financial burden Erin's parents would endure. To date over $17000.00 has been raised and it has helped tremendously. Thank you is such a simple expression for the gratitude we have for each contribution. Erin is in remarkably good spirits considering all she has endured. For her experiences she has gained a remarkable vocabulary of medical terminology and a steadfast resolve in facing the challenges ahead. The team at CHOP extraordinary in the research and care they have provided erin as well as the support for brad and christen. In addition to her medical care Erin has a wonderful and strong support system of family and friends that have helped her parents everyday with tasks both big and small. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all the donations meals prepared gifts sent fundraisers initiated t-shirts sold inquiries made and most of all prayers for Erin and her family. She continues to be such a source of joy optimism and strength despite this obstacle and for that we are all so grateful. Please keep the prayers coming they have sustained us and given us all strength in our darkest hours. I will do my best to update this page more often.

       " '\"Update 4 Posted by Susan Larson 13 months ago Share 11 January 25th\\'s chemo treatment went a little different than last time. Ok a lot different. Last time (January 4th) Evan had a reaction with the last medication they administered called Carboplatin. But we didn\\'t realize it at the time. He thought that maybe it was just something he ate that went down the wrong way and he started coughing a lot got red in the face got kind-of clammy and his stomach felt funky. So we didn\\'t think much of it and the nurses made sure he felt okay before they let him leave. But this time just as they started to give it Evan immediately felt those same symptoms. They had to stop it and give him a good amount of Benadryl by IV and his dad drove him home to sleep. The doctor explained that sometimes your body can only tolerate so much of these chemo meds and Evan\\'s body was saying \"\"I\\'m done\"\" with that one.So what\\'s next now that he\\'s completed the initial 6 cycles of chemo? Well he is scheduled for another Pet scan in about 2 weeks and that will determine the number of maintenance chemo meds he will need. He for sure will do the Avastin and the Pet scan will tell the doctor if he needs to keep the Premetrexed and do that combination which will be ongoing every 3 weeks. In addition to Pet scans every 3 months to keep a close eye on it. It\\'s much less intense and he shouldn\\'t get sick from these treatments or have side effects from what we understand. Evan had his follow up with the Radiation Oncologist and appears to be doing well according to his cognitive and physical responses. The doctor agreed that it would be a good idea to repeat the brain MRI in 2 months. He lost a little round patch of hair from the radiation but you\\'d never know it cause his long hair covers it up so well.Merry New Year!Between Christmas and New Years Eve Garrett and Madi came down from Salt Lake and Taylor and his family came up from California as well as my brother Dan Jeannie and Megan. Kenzie had to work dang it! We missed you sweetheart!Evan Danny Jeannie Hailey Taylor Megan and WillThe brave one\\'s who went side-by-side riding out in Warner Valley.

Ever since the visit from family over the holidays and the encouraging news from his Pet scan just before his 5th round of chemo there has VISIBLY been a change in Evan\\'s demeanor. There is a light about him that we\\'ve missed seeing and it\\'s back!And it\\'s simply BEAUTIFULCherry Creek Radio and the Devin Dixon Show!Bless Devin Dixon and Cherry Creek Radio.

It sure has. These last 3 weeks have been a \"\"watch and wait\"\" kind of thing. We had to see how Evan\\'s body was going to respond. This is new to us but basically he goes and gets labs drawn to see if his \"\"numbers\"\" are good and they leave the IV cath in. Then he visits with the best doctor ever and then back to the chemo area and sits and waits as the nurse changes bag after bag administering the different chemo meds. One of the ones he gets is a shot for the cancer in his bones. The nurse made us all laugh when she asked where he wanted it (stomach or arm) and he chose his stomach (the 1st time). Anyways she said she was supposed to inject it into his fat of which he has zero body fat. The medicine did not want to go in. She kept laughing cause she just couldn\\'t believe how muscly he was and the resistance of it having no where to go. Which made us all laugh. He still had a 6 pack. It\\'s kind of an interesting observation but I don\\'t think there was anyone in there under probably 60 years old. Seriously...at least that day.We now we have an \"\"idea\"\" of what to expect and we hope it is doing its job. His bones were achy the first night and the next day he was generally ok. Day 3 he got a fever and was nauseated and just plain didn\\'t feel good. Evan was very fatigued and he needed the rest. He hasn\\'t been able to work and he knew immediately he needed to withdraw from school. There was no way he could keep up. He has spent a good deal of time in bed but he doesn\\'t complain. You have to \"\"drag\"\" it out of him.This 2nd go-round has definitely been harder. Evan got sicker and has been down even more. Between beginning treatment and now he has gone out when he can to try to have as much of a social life as he feels up to. Evan\\'s friends are truly amazing. They have been here watching ball games playing games on his Play Station 4 and sometimes just being with him keeping him company. They play softball and while he can\\'t run he can swing the bat as best as he can. He tries to go the gym and he\\'ll do whatever he can or even just hang with his buddies while they workout. This mom can not say enough good about these young men. They all have jobs and are going to school and they keep Evan engaged. As much as we as a family do everything we can his friends are his friends and there are things that only THEY can do. And he needs them in a different way. They have been there every step of the way. Our hearts are filled with a profound gratitude for each one of them.

       " '\"Update 6 Posted by Evelyn Williams 2 months ago Share Hey Family!It\\'s been some time since I logged in to give you an update and unfortunately this is not an update but you will want to ready on.Today is Christmas Eve and I could not let the year end without say to very special words to each and every one of you.Those 2 words are : THANK YOU!As I type them it honestly doesn\\'t feel like enough. I wish I could find better words than thank you. What I want to convey to you you is my deepest gratitude and love for you support over the past (almost) 2 years. Earlier this year was one of the toughest seasons of my life.Being diagnosed with cancer in 2016 and the financial toll it took on my was not only stressful but embarrassing. I\\'ve had to make a lot of lifestyle changes hard decisions and humble myself more times that I care to mention to ask (and receive) help. Thank you for being apart of that.I have almost felt like the past 2 years of my life have been on hold waiting for this story to be over but one day in the not so distant future I will remember this as \"\"That one time those doctors thought I had cancer\"\". And I will smile and think about all the love and encouragement that I received.Y\\'all are the absolute best!!! Just writing this is making my eyes water. (And if you know me in real life you know that I am a super crier LOL)I hope this year has been good to you and your family and even if it hasn\\'t been your best year I can tell you from personal experience that you will get through it and there is a great life on the other side.What these two years have taught me is invaluable.I have learned:1. Trust God. He always has your best interest in mind even when it doesn\\'t feel like it.2. It\\'s okay not to be okay. (as long as you don\\'t stay that way)3. Counseling and Therapy are essential. #FightMe#OrCallMeIfYouNeedRecommendations #Seriously4. Love on people as much as you can. (even if they can\\'t/don\\'t/won\\'t love you back)5. Be intentional about EVERYTHING!!! (your life your relationships your health your money your mental and spiritual well being) don\\'t let your life drift.6. Rest is Biblical & Essential. #DontHustleOrGrind #ItsNotThatSerious #AgainFightMe7. Laugh a LOT on purpose.8. Let go. (no explanation needed)9. Change your mind and start over.10. Perspective is everything. It will make or break a situation.11. Set healthy Boundaries for you then stick to them.12. Let People be who they are and just chill. It\\'s exhausting trying to make someone something they are not.13. Ask for what you want and what you need. The worst answer you can get is no. #JustDoItAlreadyThat\\'s all I\\'ve got for now. May not seem like anything super deep on paper but in practical application it\\'s plenty!Just so you know physically I\\'m feeling great and ready to get back to my old self. As far as everything else I\\'m rebuilding one day at a time and creating a new normal.Thank you again so much for your love prayers support calls texts emails and even just your kind thoughts.Before I go I have to send a few special shout outs:1. To my IRL (in real life) friends and family: I love you! thanks for putting up with my mood swings crazy ideas lack of calling and responding to texts and my spontaneous crying. LOL2. To my internet friends and family: I love you! Thanks for rocking with me for all of these years even when I\\'ve been inconsistent and failed you. Y\\'all really are the MVPs! Your support for a \\'stranger\\' is humbling. And I\\'ve got some things coming for you that you won\\'t believe. Time to GET IT!3. To my Tuskegee University Fam: I love you! We ride for each other. No one really understands what it means to be a part of our special family. We ride for each other whether we have met or not and I truly appreciate you for everything.4.

       " '\"Update 9 Posted by Eileen Sharkey-Evans 28 months ago Share 22 Hi Everyone - I wanted to share an update from Maddy\\'s family that was written by her mom Vicki for all of you. ..The past seven weeks have taken our family on an emotional journey we wish no other family ever has to endure. When the idea of any kind of fundraising was proposed to us in those early weeks it was something we couldn\\'t hear of or think about. We were struggling to simply digest the gravity of the news we had been given and to associate Madelyn\\'s name tied to any sort of donation effort  quite honestly was too overwhelming. My boss Ryan who is also a great friend was adamant that it was not an option for us. He was \"\"pulling rank\"\" and pushed forward as an attempt to try and compensate for the lost salary we would have to forfeit this year while focusing on Madelyn and our family. And thus through his efforts and Eileens a GoFundMe Campaign was launched. Simply put we are in AWE of the generosity of so many. Friends family co-workers soccer teams karate families friends of friends strangers teachers doctors church members......the list goes on. We feel infinitely blessed. We are sincerely humbled. And we are eternally grateful. And we are thankful beyond what these words alone can ever express. As we move further along each day with Madelyn\\'s treatment the reality of the financial toll becomes more clear. The treatment of this disease by nature is a marathon not a sprint. Through the efforts raised here it has afforded us the ability to put our attention solely where it needs to be and that is getting Madelyn to the finish line. On Tuesday 11/10 we reached the first of many necessary milestones when we were given the news that she is officially in remission. As we cautiously celebrate this victory we know we still have a long way to go. With the deepest of love and appreciation we want to thank everyone for not just thinking of us and praying for us but also for helping us. We most certainly look forward to the opportunity to pay it forward! As this Thanksgiving approaches please know that we are so very thankful for you!Love Kevin Vicki Landon Madelyn and Reese Maddy was able to come see her soccer team play - it was an awesome day!+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Eileen Sharkey-Evans 28 months ago Share 22 Wow!!

       " \"Update 6 Posted by Katie Corbin 35 months ago Share Last time I wrote I let you know that Adam’s white cell count was very low. This was to be expected since the chemo goes after fast growing cells and white blood cells are fast growing cells. When we got his test results during week two his white cell count was down to .8 (the normal range is 3.5-11) so we became very cautious hermits. He gets a shot of a drug called Neulasta after each treatment and this shot activates his white blood cells forcing them to regenerate at a higher rate than normal. So we were hopeful that the next test would show better results. And boy did it. Last week’s results were high…like really high…like his count was up to 25 (!). And that meant we were able to attend Uncle Dan’s wake.It was really important for both of us to be there so we made a day trip to Indiana to say goodbye. Even though Adam’s body was fighting infection at a superhuman rate we were extremely careful and are proud to say we’re keeping Purell in business. He handled it all very well and felt great for the rest of the week. On Monday we started round two and had no allergic response to the Rituxan this time. Today he gets his pump changed and on Friday we finish all the chemo drugs. On Sunday he gets Neulasta again and we start week two.As many of you know last August Adam started a new job with Madison Metro driving city buses. This is an awesome job and he loves it but they require all new hires to start as part time workers driving kids to and from school. This part time period lasts as long as it takes until they need full time workers and drivers are promoted by seniority. Because he’s a part time worker he does not receive benefits from his employer.We accepted that situation because we were able to get insurance via the Health Care Marketplace (you know…Obamacare). We initially got a plan which cost us $0/month but had a multi-thousand dollar deductible. We were sure it would be enough to tide us over until Adam went full time…because nothing was gonna happen to him. But in December when Adam started showing signs of what we thought was a blocked tear duct we changed our plan to a better one and are so grateful we did that.No matter what your politics are and I know people have many varied feelings about politics and Obama and Obamacare and health care in general we are so lucky we had the ability to get Adam health care. I did a little math and if we hadn’t changed the plan we would owe $53614.00 right now and that’s just for a month and a half of treatment. That debt would impact us for the rest of our lives would impact our son’s life and future and we would undoubtedly lose our house. My heart goes out to all the people who are in this situation without anything to fall back on. I can’t imagine how much harder this would all be with a crappy insurer or no insurance at all.All right that’s enough editorializing. We plan to stay busy treating this cancer and thinking about all of the lovely people in our lives and how blessed we are to know all of you. So much love to you! And stay away from me because apparently I have pneumonia. + Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Katie Corbin 36 months ago Share We’re officially over halfway through Adam’s first round of chemotherapy and things are as we expected they would be. Week two has been full of weird body aches jaw pain stomach cramps night sweats dizziness and lightheadedness. Fortunately he hasn’t had all of these symptoms at the same time. We’ve both had a cold and Milo is getting his one year molars so our house has been grumpy cranky and messy. Adam’s dad Mike stayed with us for a few days so I could work and his presence was both helpful and very much appreciated.Adam’s white blood cell count was low on Thursday when we had our most recent blood test so we’re being very careful to stay away from germs. This makes it hard to socialize but hopefully next week things will rebound. We hear that he will feel the best during week three and are looking forward to a slightly more normal existence.Right now our hearts are heavy as we found out that Adam’s Uncle Dan died this morning. He was Adam’s godfather and he was a very special man. I was nervous to meet him when Adam and I started dating because I knew how important he was to Adam. In retrospect I had nothing to worry about because Uncle Dan was kind and easy to love. He and Aunt Gloria always treated me like a niece and I’m grateful I was included in their family. He was a very special man and we will miss him forever.As always we send each of you our love and gratitude. May tomorrow be a better day.Milo checking out Dad's new hair+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Katie Corbin 36 months ago Share We’re midway through the first week of chemotherapy and things have been progressing very well. Before we started this journey I had no real idea about what would happen during Adam’s treatment. When my dad went through chemo I didn’t ask enough questions and only had a vague idea of what this would all be like. I’ve got a much better picture now. We started on Monday with an immunotherapy drug called Rituxan…known in my household as the miracle drug. This crazy concoction breaks down tumors and marks cancerous cells as targets for chemo. It’s made from among other things mouse proteins. Turns out Adam’s body doesn’t like mouse proteins and he had an allergic reaction during treatment. His head got itchy then very very red and they immediately stopped the drug and ran a bunch of Benadryl through the IV while checking his vitals every few minutes. After we got the reaction under control the drug was started again but we were only able to get through half the necessary dosage. We finished up on Tuesday with no further drama.Adam receives his IV drugs through a PICC line which has been inserted in his arm. A tube runs through a vein into the superior vena cava and from there it flows quickly through his body. This line will stay in his arm until the end of treatment. He’s not irritated by it and it’s pretty inconspicuous. He started the chemo drugs when we were done with the Rituxan on Tuesday. Adam’s treatment is very aggressive and used to be done only in the hospital (he would have to be admitted for four days during each cycle). They’ve recently figured out that the same medications can be administered through an external pump and Adam is the first patient that our health care provider is treating this way. I’m happy he’s their guinea pig cause it means he gets to stay at home. The pump was attached on Tuesday and the chemo has been flowing at a very slow rate over 48 hours. Today we had to go in and get a refill and in two days they’ll detach the pump. Then that part will be over until the next round.Since his treatment was postponed for a day because of the allergic reaction we’ll have to go to the hospital on Saturday to receive the final IV of chemo drugs (the clinic is closed on the weekends). That’s kind of a bummer but you can all come visit us if you’re nearby. :) Two days after the final IV he’ll have a shot which will help his white blood cells regenerate. And that’s pretty much what a round of chemotherapy looks like for Adam. He’s feeling very well so far and hasn’t had any real side effects yet. Part of that is explained by the massive dose of prednisone he’s taking every day and all of the other drugs which manage the nastier effects of this treatment. We’re told he’ll probably crash when he stops taking the prednisone and that next week is going to be rough. But we’re taking it one day at a time and focusing on the positives we find in this experience.You may not believe me but Adam is constantly talking about how lucky he is. And that’s because of each of you. Thank you for all you’ve done to lift our spirits strengthen our resolve and provide for us. I really am not able to say that enough. Love to each of you!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Katie Corbin 36 months ago Share From Katie: I have to admit my head is still spinning a little bit from all of the information we received today but I’ll cut to the news. Adam has been diagnosed with Stage 2 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. This cancer is an aggressive one and the doctor plans to treat it aggressively. He will begin chemo next Monday. The great news is that treatment has an 80% success rate and the cancer has only spread to the lymph nodes in his neck. There’s still a mass in his sinus cavity and they’ll monitor the success of the chemo by how that mass reacts. The main side effect of the chemo will be fatigue and loss of appetite and he will lose his hair. He plans to shave his head this weekend. He’ll have 6 rounds of chemotherapy lasting 3 weeks each. He is optimistic and positive as I'm sure you all guessed he would be. We're grateful for your kind words support and prayers. We are so lucky to have you all in our lives and can't thank you enough for everything you do.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 6 Posted by Kathy Bannon 1 month ago Share Adding insult to injury I’ve developed a terrible cold. Thursday I had a scratchy throat Friday my nose became a faucet & I had developed a full chest cold with cough that was just painful. Today I can barely talk & now my cough has become productive & is continuing to move further down in my chest. It feels like my chest is going to rip out of my body with every cough. All the while I just had chemo last Monday praying that pneumonia doesn’t settle in my lungs as my immune system weakens from the chemotherapy. Praying to hear from my daughter Kelly as well. I just want to hear her voice. I’ve been texting her I love her so much and my Grandson Avery is so adorable I want to spend time with them so badly. My heart is heavy knowing I will have to receive chemotherapy every 3 weeks for as long as I live sometimes I just want to give up. Please continue praying and know how much I appreciate your thoughts prayers & support. I love you all??+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Kathy Bannon 2 months ago Share I-have been extremely ill so I must apologize for not updating this fundraising site sooner. Now with Stage4 Breast Cancer Metastatic Lymph Node and Bone involvement I have completed a round of chemotherapy that was brutal at the very least and my ability to tolerate it was not great. I spent a great deal of time in the hospital and was unable to receive medication to boost my immune system as I originally did when I 1st had Breast Cancer due to the fact that the Lymph Nodes are your immune filters and we couldn’t have boosted that stated or the chemotherapy would have been a waste of time. There was a mistake made and a time frame wasted that cost me thee use of my right arm. But by the Grace ofcGod I am alive and still fighting for my life. That said I have to update this more often I apologize for not getting to it sooner than now. The fundraising process has become fractured into multiple accounts and projects that are being organized and operated by so many wonderful people that I have come in contact with in my lifetime. My family friends or professional colleagues have spread all over the world in fact. It’s been amazing to see how far reaching social media has come since it’s inception. I know that in the 1990’s I would never have imagined that my web site would have in fact made the most impact on lives that it did. I’m so very proud that my work did pay off in a good way for people to be able to care for their self or loved ones in their homes with those teaching guides. I’m a Real Nurse & always did the right thing for my patients & wouldn’t have had it any other way. The work was hard but rewarding no doubt.

       " \"Update 1 Posted by Kelsey Frauenheim 41 months ago Share First off we are so overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and amount of support that has been shown to Bryan. He is so lucky and extremely blessed to have so many people who care about him and who are pulling for him. Thank you thank you thank you to everyone who has donated to his fund come to visit him and who has been lifting him up in prayers and keeping him in their thoughts. All of the support and encouragement means so much to him and to all of us. Bryan is doing extremely well. Going into this the doctors laid out everything for us to expect throughout this. They told us that Bryan would lose his appetite become weaker and that it was nearly inevitable for him to contract some sort of infection while his immune system was down. He has defied all of this. Bryan's appetite is hearty he feels better than he did coming into the hospital and has shown no signs of any type of infection. His outlook is incredible and he is determined to stay healthy. What a tough dude!Bryan finished his first round of seven continuous days of chemotherapy 11 days ago and had his second bone marrow aspiration on Monday to determine how well the treatment worked. The results came back last night and the chemo definitely served its purpose. Coming into the hospital Bryan had 95% - 99% cancerous cells and as of yesterday he has 8%. Praise the Lord!In addition to killing Bryan's cancerous cells the chemotherapy also killed all of his healthy white blood cells which was expected. White blood cells are what help our bodies to fight off infection so Bryan's immune system is very low and he is considered neutropenic. This means that his body would have a very difficult time fighting off even the smallest amount of germs leaving him very susceptible to infection. This forces anyone who is in the room with him to wear a mask continually sanitize their hands and have no physical contact with Bryan. The chemotherapy killed all of Bryan's active cells including the cells that form together to create the roots of your hair. His hair began to slowly fall out this last weekend so he beat the cancer to the punch and shaved it all off! Let me tell you he is as handsome as ever. His doctor ordered him to be taken off of any IV fluids so he no longer has to drag around his IV pole and has had a few opportunities to go outside for a few minutes and get some fresh air!Bryan will be undergoing at least one more round of chemotherapy before he can leave the hospital for now. The hope throughout this round will be for the treatment to completely wipe out all cancerous cells leaving Bryan with 0%. Once that round of chemo is complete he will remain in the hospital as his immune system and white blood cell count will be even lower. The doctors will do another bone marrow aspiration and decide where to go from there once the results come back.Thank you so much again for the abundant flow of support. We have been left speechless so many times in realizing just how many people are pulling for Bryan. In regards to this Go Fund Me account I am so in awe of how giving and selfless all of you are and how quickly the goal of $5000 was raised. We are so thankful and so glad that Bryan can focus solely on healing rather than worrying about the financial aspect of all of this. From the bottom of my heart thank you. We love you all. xoxo Kelsey+ Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 817 total shares\",\n",

The news we\\'ve been wanting to hear has come.........\"\"Connor is ALL CLEAR...No evidence of disease\"\"!!! After 15 months of: brain surgery 30 proton beam radiation treatments many physical therapy sessions MRIs hospital stays and 48 weeks of chemo Connor has finished treatments and can try to be a kid again.He will have a lot of physical therapy sessions to help with the neuropathy in his legs and feet.

He will go in for final testing mostly to see if he can handle the transplant process which I am sure he will with ease. Then the bone marrow Josh needs will be transplanted within the month. This is a great time with high hopes. It is also a reminder that the fight isn't over. The next leg of his journey is about to begin. Keep supporting Josh as he needs it for the length of this fight. You're doing great. Josh's spirits are high.

       " \"Update 1 Posted by Anne Garza 15 months ago Share Happy Holidays:) As most of you know we moved in search of better care for Ruben. Loyola came to a standstill with option and recommended alternative treatment. We were suppose to move to California and start a trial study. But God redirected our steps to Arizona. We are facing many obstacles here and after 7 months of not working not having adequate medical insurance and so many other factors we are in need of prayer agreement of a blessing. Leaving behind our home and my career to take a leap of faith was the hardest decision I ever made. Ruben is still taking daily chemotherapy treatment at a very high cost. Please share text and spread the word of this campaign. I prayed for a miracle and as the days grow closer to the due date I am very nervous and worried.

       " \"Update 5 Posted by Colleen Glenney 14 days ago Share Hi everyone! Update time! Kate is hanging in there but it's been a struggle over the past few months. She's now done with radiation and had a lot of nasty side effects including open sores and burning on her skin. Because of these side effects she had to stop the oral chemo in order to let her skin heal. She went down to MD Anderson the leading hospital for breast cancer this week which was great. She did find out that while the MD Anderson folks are referring to her cancer as metastatic and between stages 3 and 4 they still feel it's curable which is the most important thing. From her most recent PET scan it looks like the cancer that was in her mammary nodes is gone but there's a new area that could be just inflammation or could be cancer - Kate will return in May to MD Anderson for a new scan then to see how it has progressed. In the meantime she's restarting the oral chemo for a few more months. We (Kate and her family) are so incredibly grateful to the many friends and family who have given their time meals donations and most importantly prayers and love to Kate (and us) during this time. Kate has done such a great job being positive and fighting this battle but it's not easy! Thank you to everyone for your support. + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Colleen Glenney 9 months ago Share 11 Hi everyone! So yesterday was a big day for Kate - head shaved and wig fitted. The timing was perfect because her hair started falling out last week. Kate's now had 2 chemo treatments and the doctor was able to tell a decrease in tumor size even after the first treatment! So that was very encouraging news. Kate's still feeling pretty good overall as long as she gets good naps in (which is one of her favorite things in the world anyway so she doesn't need much encouragement). Here are some pics of the big day and the unveiling of Lola her new awesome wig!Shaving the headGetting some love from her friend KarinKate and her friends there in support!+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Colleen Glenney 9 months ago Share You guys! You guys! An anonymous donor donated enough to meet our $7000 goal!!!! This is so amazing and absolutely tear-inducing. Kate just had to pay $6400 out of pocket today for her treatment and so this couldn't come at a better time. THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!! Here's a pic of the happy camper starting her fight with her first chemo infusion today - look at that smiling face. She's going to beat this thing! + Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Colleen Glenney 9 months ago Share Hello everyone - thank you so much for your donations. We were thrilled to find out today that Kate's cancer has NOT metastasized beyond some lymph nodes. Her cancer is still at stage 3C on a scale of 1-4 due to its aggressive nature but now she has a fighting chance and we can talk about the fight vs life expectancy. Kate starts chemo tomorrow and will do that for the next 5 months followed by mastectomy and radiation. The support she (and we) have gotten from everyone is absolutely stunning.

       " \"Update 9 Posted by Carolyn Banda 12 days ago Share It is with great sadness that we announce Rolando lost his battle with cancer on February 4th. However we rejoice in the knowing he is free from all he suffered and is with God in eternal freedom. Any donations made from here on out will go to his widow Carolyn and their children. God bless you all.+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Carolyn Banda 19 months ago Share A bit has happened since we updated last month. Rolando was going to start a clinical trial at U of C but it was a no-go due to pancreatic enzyme levels being out of range. He continues with several treatments that were started in Mexico and as I mentioned last time the cancer has not spread beyond the lymph nodes which is great. However Rolando has been in a lot of pain and needs relief.We have been in touch with the surgeon who has done three prior surgeries on Rolando and he has agreed to go in and remove all the tumors that he can. This should help a lot with the pain and pressure not to mention the physical exhaustion that he suffers as these tumors drain the energy from his body.This amazing surgeon has however moved from Chicago to Vanderbilt in Nashville so we will be headed there next week for this surgery. We ask that you keep us in your thoughts and prayers during this time as well as our family at home. I am so grateful for my in-laws who will be helping with keeping our household running (as the kids keep them hopping) while we are away.As always we thank each and every one of you for your love and support.

Though he was scanned prior to the trip and we knew going down that there has been tumor growth we are happy that nothing has spread into any other organs. This is very encouraging news.We have things to consider including treatment options and an invitation for him to be involved in a clinical trial here in Chicago. We are still in this fight and grateful to all who have contributed and are fighting alongside us.Love to you all.+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Carolyn Banda 22 months ago Share 22 It's been a little over a month since we returned from Hope4Cancer clinic in Mexico. I cannot begin to describe just how amazing and life-changing this place is. We walked in there as a patient and caregiver and walked out of there forever changed. Not merely because of the treatments and the amazing staff but because of the love and true friendships that were formed in the three weeks that we were there.I am still trying to process all we experienced but I'm left with this feeling that we are like a band of soldiers who have been thrown together to fight an enemy (cancer). We bonded quickly linked arms and held each other up. We laughed together and cried together. We still do (thanks to Facebook). We celebrate the victories encourage through the set-backs and mourn the losses. We love. And we know there is hope.Rolando walked out of that clinic with a 40% decrease in blood flow to the tumors. His blood work was much better than when he walked in. This is a victory. We continue with at-home treatments and therapies (including Rigvir injections and PNC-27). We will be returning to Mexico for the first follow-up visit in June.We are grateful for all of your love and support throughout this exhausting battle.

       " '\"Update 9 Posted by Carolyn Glasshoff 30 months ago Share Hello all! Fisher has been in treatment for a while and the family seems to have settled into a crazy version of a new normal for now. I got to see Fisher and his dad not too long ago for lunch after a hospital day and he was in really good spirits. Keep sending good wishes and prayers their way! Fisher\\'s hair had started thinning with the treatments but it recently started falling out in clumps. Instead of waiting for it to just fall out they had some fun and gave Fisher a mohawk for a bit. He seems like he really enjoyed that! And from the pictures his dad posted it looks like he\\'s ready to take on anything!We still have small waves of donations which is awesome--the word is still spreading! I\\'m going to be hosting a virtual 5k soon to help with funding (sign up then run where/when is convenient for you!). Just figuring out pricing on goodies to send out to participants. :) Like always keep sharing keep praying and keep Fisher and his family in your thoughts! Thanks for all you do! This kid can fight off anything!+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Carolyn Glasshoff 33 months ago Share Hello friends! First a little while back we hit our initial goal of $10k! You guys are amazing! We will continue to fundraise throughout this battle and I have some ideas for fun fundraising things in the coming months (any runners out there? I\\'m talking to you!). Thank you thank you! Second we have an update from the family. They\\'ve been through a lot in the past 30 days so please continue to keep Fisher and his parents in your thoughts and prayers. Update below. :) ~~~~~~~~~~It’s been almost a month since our last update but it feels like a year’s worth of activity has taken place. During our last update we talked about Fisher’s emergency room visit after a lumbar puncture (aka spinal tap or LP) went bad. The following week he was due for another one but his doctor decided to do an MRI instead to make sure the last dose of the spinal chemotherapy drug had not caused any changes to his brain. Fortunately the MRI was clear. Fisher went to Shands the next week for another LP and came home fit as a fiddle. During that time he was able to have a few friends over to play video games and hang out including another Leukemia patient who has completed his treatments and now plays electric guitar in a band. He also had a fun visit from his Kindergarten teacher.The next week saw Fisher back at Shands for another LP with chemo. He came home the next day and started having problems including headaches and nausea. It got to the point where we had no choice but to take him back to the ER. They resolved his dehydration but the headaches and nausea persisted. Fisher spent most of that week lying in bed or on the couch miserable but by Wednesday Fisher was starting to feel better.This past Thursday Fisher was back at Shands for a check-up and a regular chemo IV (no LP this time!). During the office visit we discussed Fisher’s issues with the LP procedure and asked why he was getting sick from them and whether or not this was normal behavior. His doctor hypothesized that Fisher may have a hematoma inside his spine caused by the trauma of the LPs. Since his next LP will not be for 30 days and since Fisher is feeling better now the doctor believes that the hematoma may not be pressing on his spinal nerve and will resolve itself naturally.Overall Fisher is progressing very well. We’re holding our breath for the next LP but are hoping that the hematoma issue will be resolved by then. He’s almost lost all of the fullness to his face and belly caused by the initial steroid treatment too and is looking like his old self again.Since his ANC count (i.e. his ability to resist infections) is relatively high for a kid going through chemo. Fisher is enjoying a visit with his friend Bryce. We went to a late dinner and took pictures beforehand because Bryce and Fisher decided to make it a formal event. Today we all went to a matinee showing of Jurassic World in 3-D and had a ball. Fisher had to wear a mask but that didn’t stop him from having fun. With the 3-D glasses on he looked a bit like a doctor.Fisher’s three-year treatment cycle starts now so we still have a long road ahead. Fisher continues to receive cards and notes from classmates schoolmates friends family and churches. He loves reading every one. We also learned from our friend Claire that Fisher has picked up new prayer warriors in Lourdes France!That’s it for now. As always keep those prayers rolling in!Fisher all snazzy for his outing! + Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Carolyn Glasshoff 34 months ago Share I got an update from Fisher’s family on Thursday: After 5 weeks we are in our own beds! Fisher had a rough week but he’s pulling through it and is maintaining his positive attitude. Yesterday was his last steroid day for a while. He had been taking a very high dose for 29 days which caused several immediate side effects. His body shape was changing his balance deteriorated he became much weaker than before and his organs became enlarged. He also had “weird food” cravings but I’ll get back to that one in a bit. Fisher’s face and abdomen began to swell a few weeks ago and came to a crescendo by the end of last week. He was physically uncomfortable because his poor little tummy was so distended – the skin stretched taught as if carrying twins. He was also plagued with chipmunk cheeks…on steroids. Yesterday evening was his last dose of steroids and I can already tell that his body shape is changing for the better. While he’s still extremely puffy his face is starting to slim down to its normal shape. Fisher’s loss of balance was (and is) even more disturbing. We were told that the problem is caused mostly by the steroids but it’s also a side effect of his chemotherapy. After a clinic visit this past Monday where Fisher could easily balance on one foot for over a minute his balance went completely out the window. He began falling when walking across the room complaining that he had slipped when he clearly just fell. On another day he was standing in front of a bookcase and fell over right in front of us. He said he slipped but he didn’t; he just fell over. He has now learned to walk slowly and we have learned to hold his hand or to create a protective zone around him with our arms any time he is standing (because we’re paranoid and scared of him getting hurt). Fisher is understandably annoyed by our overprotectiveness but he’s stuck with us. His weakness was probably the most concerning to us and to Fisher. On Monday when his balance failed him he also became extremely weak. He could not sit up under his own power. He could not stand up from a squat without someone helping him. He also had a hard time standing from a sitting position. The situation marked the first time that Fisher confided in me that he was scared. I told him that the problem was temporary and that he just needed a good night’s sleep. Secretly I was hoping I was right. The next morning Fisher popped up out of bed and started to walk across the room. I jumped up and created my protective barrier around him but he claimed to be just fine. And he was. While still wobbly he was able to stand from a seated position and was able to walk without falling. Just to be safe we declared that day “couch day” and kept him in one place relaxing. His strength returned to an even greater degree the following day and he is now doing pretty well as long as he walks slowly and deliberately. Monday was “scare day” apparently because that was also the day that we learned about Fisher’s swollen organs. As any parent would do we were watching Fisher’s physician like a hawk as he performed a physical exam of his abdomen. We could see the concern on his face before he said “His liver is enlarged. I’m going to order an ultrasound.” What made matters worse was the fact that we waited so long before the ultrasound was performed that day for two reasons. First and foremost he had an enlarged liver. Second he’s temporarily diabetic due to the steroids and was going on 5 hours without food because he wasn’t allowed to eat or drink prior to the ultrasound. Upon our return to the clinic we were told that he had an enlarged liver and spleen but that the condition was most likely steroid induced. They are going to keep an eye on it. Fisher’s temporary diabetes played a role in his spinal tap and bone marrow biopsy procedure performed today as well. We were instructed to arrive at Shands at 7:30am but he was not taken into surgery until after 10:30am. So we had a nice scare there because his blood sugar dipped below 70 (which is bad). With Fisher coming off of steroids everyone is watching his blood sugar because his temporary diabetes may go away slowly or may go away quickly. The goal now is to make sure we don’t overcorrect with insulin (i.e. keep his blood glucose level from going too high) or under-correct and allow his blood sugar to dip below 70. Low blood sugar is much more dangerous and detrimental to the body than are high levels of glucose. The good news is that it appears his body is starting to take over again by producing the correct amount of insulin on its own. Now for the “weird food” craving. Steroids cause people to eat. That’s a very normal reaction. Fisher is not your ordinary kid and has a new spin on steroid-induced food cravings. He has developed an interest in trying new foods as a hobby. Here’s his ideal restaurant menu…at the moment at least. I think when he looks back on this menu later on he will probably be shocked that he had such cravings. Appetizers: - Balut (Duck Embryo Steamed in the Shell) - Live Octopus (Squirming in Sesame Oil) - Tuna Eyeballs (Enough Said) - Fried Spiders (I Give Up) - Gumbo with Carolina Reaper Pepper (At Least This One is Normal) Salads: - Jumping Salad (Salad with Live Shrimp) - Insect Caviar (Yuck) Entrée: - Armadillo - Lamb Brain - Birds Nest Soup - Softshell Turtle - Silkie Chicken - Iguana - Canard à la Rouennaise (Duck in Blood Sauce or Pressed Duck) - Haggis Dessert: - Pig’s Blood Cake - Hasma (I can’t bring myself to describe what this is and suggest that you Google it if you’re curious) I want to be clear that Fisher has performed research on these foods only. While he has asked repeatedly to try these dishes (especially the armadillo) we have not acquiesced. (Note that armadillos carry Leprosy!!) At this point we are home in Tallahassee and are glad to be here. The plan is for Fisher to visit Shands two days a week for the next four months. In the meantime he is enjoying reading his many cards from family family friends and (especially) classmates. He is also enjoying all of the “pick me up” gifts he’s received such as the signed T-shirt from the Tallahassee Battle Wrestling Club the care package from Cool Kids Campaign the many games and Legos and his Dr. Who pillow case cup madlib and bookmark (just to name a few). Finally he is looking forward to having some of his friends over to hang out on the couch to play video games or paint. We will continue to keep you posted on Fisher’s progress. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers as we will receive the results of his spinal tap and bone marrow biopsy next week. Those results will dictate how the doctors plan to proceed with the rest of his treatment. I truly believe in the power of prayer and Fisher definitely has some prayer power supporting him. At this point he has individuals families entire church congregations and a university praying for him in 22 states and 5 countries including Canada Germany Denmark Spain and Pakistan.Please keep sharing this page and Fisher’s story so we can continue to get more support for our brave little guy! Thank you everyone!+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Carolyn Glasshoff 34 months ago Share Some more good news! Fisher\\'s test results came back with the specific genetic makeup of his leukemia and he is on the \"\"better than expected\"\" end of the spectrum. He is on the lower risk end for his type of leukemia! As a reward for as his dad says his excellent test-taking abilities Fisher picked out a model of Leonardo DaVinci\\'s paddleboat to put together and has been working on that and a Lego dragon. His dad also said that for the moment Fisher is not allowed to eat seafood. This is apparently on his mind because as they were watching Pirates of the Caribbean he started pointing out all the types of seafood and talking about how he would cook each one. Things are still tough but this is looking to be a better week. :)+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 21 Posted by Brian Radakovic 28 months ago Share 11 I want to update everyone on Conner Radakovic\\'s progress with his battle with Leukemia. On October 13 he started the last phase of his treatment plan called Maintenance. This phase will continue for the next 2 & 1/2 years. Conner will keep the port in his chest during Maintenance and beyond. Since Conner\\'s diagnosis in January we have been traveling weekly to UNC for Chemo therapy . Now in Maintenance we will be going to UNC every 4 weeks for Chemo therapy while taking numerous pills at home daily. Conner will be immunosuppressed for the next 2 & 1/2 years while in Maintenance. This means he will be more susceptible to viruses and bacteria. We have to maintain our vigilance in keeping Conner safe from diseases. He is not able to attend pre school now but is expected to attend kindergarten next fall. Throughout all this Conner has been in good spirits thanks in part to you. Thank you for your continued prayers.Karen and Brian RadakovicConner loves to dress up and go on secret missions+ Read MoreUpdate 20 Posted by Brian Radakovic 29 months ago Share Yesterday October 13 2015 Conner started Maintenance!!!This is quite a big deal for children with ALL. The last 9 months Conner has had chemo either every 7 days or every 10 days at UNC\\'s Cancer Hospital. As of yesterday Conner will go to UNC only every 4 weeks for chemo. He has a lot more oral chemo to take at home (pills) than he has had in the past. which is something he has always struggled with. Here is glimpse of Conner\\'s schedule now.Mercaptopurine -1 tab every night 1 1/2 tab Sat/Sun nights. Nothing to eat/drink 1 hour prior.Septra - 1 1/2 tab every MWF.Dexamethasone - 4.5 tabs by mouth twice a day with meals for 5 days in a row every 4 weeks.Methotrexate- take 6 tabs by mouth every Wednesday. Do not take the week of spinal tabs.His clinic schedule is every 4 weeks.Check blood counts check up administrator Vincristine via port.Every 12 weeks he will also be sedated for LP (spinal tap) in order to administer methotrexate in his spine. Conner\\'s schedule will continue like this for the next 2 1/2 years. Also sometime in the next couple of months Conner will be able to return to church and go to kindergarten next fall.The tricky part about Conner returning to a \"\"normal\"\" life is when he contracts a cold. When Conner develops a fever it is an automatic trip to the ER for antibiotic therapy to protect his port. I am anticipating many missed school days because of what may be \"\"going around\"\" the classroom.Conner will have a 504 plan in place at school and if he hospitalized or absent to avoid contracting something (especially during flu season). The school system will send a home bound teacher or offer an I pad so that he may participate virtually.The doctors use a number that is referred to as his- anc -. This number is his calculated ability for his body to fight infection. The standard range is 2.0-7.5. Yesterday Conner\\'s was a 3.0. During the next 2 1/2 years they want that number to be at 1.5 which means he is immuno-compromised. Conner wants very much to return to church and school and we want that too. Conner needs to be more aware of the environment around him. In addition to staying clear of sick people he cannot play with sand/dirt/rocks because of the risk of bacteria. To me this is the most confusing part of treatment what can and cannot Conner do?Conner handles it all like a true super hero. He has felt good bad safe and scared. It has been hard watching my baby go through all this. He really is a super hero??Thank you to everyone for following us on Conner\\'s journey to Zap Leukemia. Thank you for all the monetary donations and gift packages for Conner. He really enjoys them. Please continue to pray for him and all the brave children we have met at the cancer hospital. Cancer really does suck. I have seen so many children and families suffer because of this awful disease.Thank you again and God bless you .Conner and his 165 beads of courage ??+ Read MoreUpdate 19 Posted by Brian Radakovic 31 months ago Share Conner had a clinic appt. last Tuesday 8/11 but his counts were too low for him to receive chemo. Yesterday 8/18 he went back and his counts were much better and was able to proceed with the next cycle!So yesterday was Day 1 of Interm Maintence 2. He was sedated and given MTX in his spine and afterwards he was given MTX and Vincristine through his port. He did very well and we were done by 10am.Conner will go to clinic every 10 days for the next 8 weeks.

       " \"Update 43 Posted by Lorenita Lucas 12 months ago Share 11 HeyQuick update on an update. My last update's saltiness was seasoned by the fact that I have lots of new info from people with new cancer diagnoses. It's a blessing that I can be there for them. In all cases I am one of only a handful of people that know... in 1 case I am the only person that knows. I am apparently giving them what they desire and request...an honest upbeat non-judgemental spirit and an ear to listen. However I wish I could share as the truth: chemo is fun... being bald is the best... loosing your taste buds is awesome...nothing hurts...waiting for test results is like Christmas. LOL. Anywho even though it probably doesn't seem so at this moment I find it an honor to help people navigate through this thing. Love love love.+ Read MoreUpdate 42 Posted by Lorenita Lucas 12 months ago Share HELP!!!!Howdy everyone. I need help! And I am not sure what I need. Everything! Money! Prayers! Encouragement! Hope! An income stream! Contacts! A weight loss plan that can work! Help!I don’t watch TV (I do watch Netflix sometimes) but I know that conflict is what rules the screen both on TV and in movies. A show called “Scandal” was destined to succeed. So let’s consider this update an episode. Not an epistle of love and light but rather a sharing of the sadness I am feeling at this exact moment the conflict I am feeling within.I want to be happy. Yet I am so tired. I am tired of cancer of scans of tests of doctor’s visits of updates of worry of being “strong” of keeping up with appointments of thinking about the next thing to do of not being able to be stable enough to work full-time of Robin not being here and most recently of the pain. Yes the physical pain. While the neuropathy is still ever present in some way I have the added pleasure of the actual cancer causing pain in my arm and excruciatingly in my chest. It’s inflammation. I did go to a pain management specialist physician yesterday. I am currently trying a new medication regimen and I am figuring out what triggers the pain. It will take a few (long) days to see if this is a winning solution or if I need to do something else.I am so sick of this. People like to talk of this “journey” in the analogy of a “fight.” Think of a fight. A real one…Foreman vs Ali – The Rumble in the Jungle. Although a boxing fight is a hard battle of strength skill endurance wit and faith the fighters get brakes between rounds and there is an actual end. Imagine if a fight such a this was 24/7…with no real rest. Lately that is how I feel. As though I am in a constant fight a never ending boxing match on about Round 420000. And let me tell you something that pretty pink ribbon can pack a punch.Yes I am still here. The fight is hard and getting harder not easier mentally emotionally or physically. I am about to start a clinical trial for which I am very happy about as I am blessed to meet the criteria. It involves some of the latest and greatest science…it’s an immunotherapy trial. There are not a lot of slots out there in immunotherapy trials for my particular type of cancer. So truly Hallelujah for that! The harsh reality is that everything else has failed (not uncommon in the cancer treatment world) and as a result this is the 5th thing I am trying in 2 years…that is very scary. Very.So again help. I am stuck. If you have been with me for more than 2 hours within the last week you can trust and believe I have been in terrible pain I just try to laugh through it though even that is getting harder to do. And even though over the past 2 plus years my threshold for pain has gotten higher cancer has been able to push past those limits and continuously teach me about pain.Please scroll back to the top and take a peek…or just remember that I need HELP! So many people tell me I need to write a book. I get asked often and I gladly do share my story in hopes of encouraging others. I do want to write. I think I could produce a great product that would have a strong positive message with actionable items for patients caregivers and communities. So please please let me know if you have any contacts within the publishing world. An advance would be lovely (and essential). I will have some time on my hands…I am about to start chemotherapy again. I can write as I sit in that chair.That’s all for now as I sound whiney to myself. I really am fighting not to be a Bitter Betty. It’s just that these last few years have been extremely hard especially with the most recent new spreading of cancer and the new pains. Of all the feelings I have at this exact moment I am pleased to note that I am not in need of feeling cared for and loved. I wish I could express that more beautifully but I am tired and I have a 6:30am doctor’s appointment and more test in a few hours.Thanks for your much needed continued financial support prayers and love. It makes me very happy to write “much love to you all!”+ Read MoreUpdate 41 Posted by Lorenita Lucas 13 months ago Share Good morning beautiful people. It's 2/3/17. I am about to have yet another PET/CT scan. Technically I could have had it at the end of this month. But with my cancer sister dying I was super sensitive about the cancer growing and asked for the scan ASAP. So now that I am here I'm kinda laughing at myself. I am going to try something new since I was so skiddish. I have a regular oncology appointment on the 16th. Rather than getting results asap I am going to try and wait 2 weeks until the appointment exercising some patience. (FYI just typing that made me a little nauseous LOL) So say a prayer please petitioning cancer free results...and that the pain totally goes away. Tomorrow would have been my cancer sister's 54th birthday. I am helping her family throw a party for her....sad and joyous.I wish you all a spectacular weekend. Much love to you all.+ Read MoreUpdate 40 Posted by Lorenita Lucas 13 months ago Share Hello everyone (ooops…it’s long…sorry...but read it please :-) )It’s been awhile since I’ve done an update. Once again thanks for continuing to care and asking for updates. A lot is happening. But first a recap.I did it! I celebrated my 50th birthday every month of 2016 for a total of 13 celebrations (2 in Jan.). All fun and all fabulous all because of the fantastic people who were present. I am so glad that I did it. It afforded me the opportunity to see so many people and quite often I was extremely surprised by who just showed up.Unfortunately 2016 will be remembered by me as a year of loss. On top of what had already occurred since my last update my cancer sister Robin died the day after Christmas. Many of you were fortunate enough to meet her. We met in December of 2014 at the doctor’s office. We were about the same age with the just about the same diagnosis at the same time with the same doctor. We seemed to always have visits and infusions for chemotherapy on the same day. We quickly became friends. Luckily for me she was a chef…she brought me tasty treats even on the days she was receiving treatment. After a time she and I decided that we were not just friends but rather sisters in this madness. We developed a closeness that allowed us to support one another through the many ups and downs (like cancer returning for both of us) that life had to offer. Together we could just be for one another…be heard and be understood. I thought that we would be a constant support for each other until the very end. Considering that I knew her so early in this and that I had her to lean on cry with travel with laugh with and more it is going to be all the harder to continue as I survive cancer. Especially at this time now with the cancer’s return which has me back on chemo. Even though the chemo is a pill it still has side effects some of which are new and others that exacerbate existing pains. As I go through this I recently realized that my sadness is selfish and bewildered. I can’t help but wonder why I am here and not her…she was a loving mother doting grandmother a joy to her family and friends...?!??!AND…there’s a new administration (adding anxiousness into my life…and yes I know Philippians 4:6)All of this has slowed me down mentally emotionally and physically. My concentration is off kilter. Adjustments to medicines have me more fatigued and lethargic. The re-occurrence of the caner and new pains have me questioning from even more dimensions how I am to gainfully make a living. Sometimes as I am going through that act of picking up the phone to call Robin before I remember that she is no longer here (those of you who have lost someone may know what I am referring to ?) I feel sad of course but nauseous as well.BUT…for me there’s WOW.Recently I did have at least one clear thought. ? If everyone had a brand for professional or external purposes as well as a personal philosophy then life can be navigated a little better when you go through tough times detours setbacks etc. While as a Christian I have Christ as a foundation for my life my brand and philosophy which are born out of my passion and personality give an extra layer of support. Luckily for me WOW is both my brand and my philosophy.As a brand it is Everyday WOW Work on Wellness. Professionally under the topic of wellness I make all types of presentations manage projects plan events teach classes and more. All to help people improve their health outcomes and feel better about themselves physically emotionally and mentally.As a philosophy it is what you have read before making the effort to have a moment each day that makes you say “WOW”. Although I know I am broke crazy sad confused and depressed because of WOW I cannot profess to feel that way all the time. WOW allows me to wholly experience the sunshine the laughter the silly moments of life. Thanks to the wonderful people that I am so blessed to have in my life I can often have more than one WOW moment each day.So I challenge you to at least get a philosophy maybe even a brand. If you wanna use my philosophy of WOW I encourage you to do so it’s loads of fun!As always I am grateful to you. I thank you so much for your continued support especially now at this moment in time. The cancer seems a little harder now than it did at the beginning.I am lucky. I am writing this right after having a WOW moment. I started getting at-home Reiki this morning. The bonus is not just that it’s from a Reiki Master but also from a cherished family friend.Please keep your support coming and the prayers especially the prayers. Please know that whenever I learn of anything going on with any of you I send up a prayer for you too. Now let’s go and get some WOW moments. Love you much!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 5 Posted by Dina Perez Handy 28 months ago Share 11 Good morning Family and Friends. I'm hoping each and everyone of you are doing great this beautiful Tuesday. I give God the glory for life and allowing me to give this amazing praise report. When I returned from New York last week for my brother's home going celebration I had an MRI and PET/CT. On yesterday I returned to the hospital to have my pic-line removed. While there the nurse told me what I already believe and trusted God for that my doctor said the test were stable and the report showed no evidence of Non-Hodgkins Lymphona. So my Family and Friends I just want to remind you to continue believe in yourself and the rest will get easier. Constantly keep yourself in the right direction. It may not be easy at times but in those times of struggle you will find a stronger sense of who u are. So when the days come that are filled with frustrations and unexpected responsibilities remember to believe in yourself and all that life is because the challenges and changes will only help you to find the dreams that you know are meant to come true for you. Keep believing in your self and most of all Trust God and keep the Faith.

Although she is in the hospital receiving her first of the last three chemo treatments her doctors gave her the gift of good news. The MRI results show that the cancer cells and swelling in her brain are decreasing. We received confirmation that the treatment for her body was effective. Her body tested negative for lymphoma!!! Praise God!! Now the focus is to eliminate it from her brain. In the beginning the brain swelling affected her ability to walk on her own. With the help of physical therapy and mom's strong will she needs the walker less and less. If this journey has shown me anything it has confirmed what I've always known...

It\\'s been a bit but I\\'ve been busy with following doctors orders and working on something. That something being the book!I still plan developing the book and also plan on someday getting published. I\\'ve talked to some companies and unfortunately because of the actual costs of publishing I do not believe traditional methods of publishing are viable.As such I am going a different route. I am going to be releasing each chapter/part of my book free online for anyone to read here and on my tumblr. For those who really want to support me I\\'ve set up a patreon.What is a patreon?

If you are new please check my past updates for a a rough of what I went through. I am planning to write a book and hope to keep updates on that. Thanks Guys!+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Franco Duerme 40 months ago Share The past two weeks have been one of the more awakening weeks I\\'ve had. I find safety when I feel content but feelings only last for so long. Two weeks ago I came out of my fourth round of chemo more alive and ready than the last time I was discharged from a hospital. I didn\\'t suffer from a lost of taste swollen tongue or much fatigue. I was ready to go home and be myself.For that weekend I did. I began playing Dota (which is a video game I hope to make a career out of playing/commentating) more frequently with my Ducksoup (an online gaming community) friends. I even began outlining and writing some of my proposed book. I was certainly content and happy until that next monday.I got a call that my red blood cell count was low from the SCCA and I needed to go to the Harrison Hospital ER for a blood transfusion. I went in at around 4-ish thinking I would be out at 6. I instead had to stay there overnight. There was much confusion between the SCCA and Harrison about my labs; SCCA said my blood was low but the Harrison doctors checked and said I was fine. This delay pushed my transfusion further and further out eventually I had to be put into a room. Hence the overnight stay.I try not to talk about the bad parts about having cancer to people in person because I do not want to show how bad cancer effects people. Inside any patient of any disease is still the same friend or family member just a bit weaker. But that day killed my positive thinking.Bringing myself through these difficult procedures blood transfusions chemo meds is the easy part. Physical pain with medical procedures are temporary; the thought that you are a fragile being that could drop into anemia an ER room or another helicopter ride leaves mental scars that are sometimes harder to deal with than physical ones.That\\'s why I have to thank you. Yes YOU. Anyone who has visited me in the hospital donated to my go fund me or even read/liked my facecbook posts. I find solace in knowing that people are out there people that care. Care about me getting better care about my well being or just care about the story i\\'m beginning to tell.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

We are so blessed to hear this news and wanted to share with everyone who has supported him in this battle. + Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Mary Danna-Scott 28 months ago Share It has been 3 months since Frank's last Chemo treatment and a month since his hip surgery. We did receive the results of the biopsy from the marrow in his femur that they removed in order to place the rod and pins to support his hip and those results were negative! Great news! Right now we do not see any need for the radiation and stem cell replacement. His follow up appointment with his Oncologist will be the beginning of December. Please continue to keep Frank in your prayers and will update as needed. Thank you again for all that have supported Frank during this ordeal.+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Mary Danna-Scott 31 months ago Share Well it has been a long 4 months of Chemo treatments. Frank had his last treatment yesterday and is preparing for the effects which usually come about 2 days after treatment. His last treatment really took a toll on his body he had lost 14 lbs in 8 days so we are not looking forward to whats to come with this last one. His blood work is excellent and the medical staff is amazed at his cell counts which we could not have done without the financial support of all of you but he still has a long road ahead of him and needs to keep up with the same methods that have got him this far. He has appointments in 5 weeks for cancer scans to re-stage him (please pray for a cancer-free result) Oncologist Orthopedic Surgeon to strength his hip bone where the Cancer destroyed the bone and marrow and than on to radiation. It has not only been difficult financially but emotionally as well. It has been 4 months and little by little the support and prayers have lessened. I cannot tell you how much it boosts not only him but myself up to receive calls or texts or messages of support this is a very isolating ordeal and unless you have gone through it you cannot understand the stress that comes along with it. Please keep Frank in your prayers and any help that is sent is deeply appreciated.+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Mary Danna-Scott 31 months ago Share Frank had another Chemo treatment this past Tuesday and is recovering from the symptoms. Each Chemo gets harder and harder to recover from. He has 1 more treatment left than it will be a waiting game it will be at least 4 weeks before he can have a cancer and bone scan to see the progress we have made. He will than have to have hip surgery before starting his 6 week round of daily radiation. For all of you still donating and offering your words of support and prayers I thank you. It is a very isolating and life changing disease and continued support is more important than anyone not going through the Cancer ordeal can imagine. God Bless You. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Back in April if you were not aware I had another tumor removed this one from my neck. The surgery appeared to be successful and it was confirmed with my recent trip down to Jacksonville. Not only is the tumor in my neck completely gone my scans showed that the tumors in and around my stomach are also shrinking proving that the treatment I have been going through has been successful thus far. I am continuing to receive treatments at UofM in Ann Arbor and every three months I still travel down to Jacksonville Fl for scans and a treatment. Thank you all for the support through thoughts prayers well wishes and donations you have passed my way through this journey. Without all of this help from my friends family community and other supporters I cannot imagine my life being in the place it is right now. Thank you again. + Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by Mark Howell 40 months ago Share We have two things to share. First is that Mark was scanned today after his second round of PD1 treatments and here’s his report:“Scans were good. Tumor in my neck is a little smaller and tumor in stomach is about the same. Continue on with treatment and keep dominating! Squadoosh”Second is that we ask that you not look at the total amount raised when you visit this page. This page has supported Mark and his family for two years. While it might seem like a big number it has been appropriately diminished over two years of very extensive copays on treatments and prescriptions and travels across the country to meet with doctors who are helping to save Mark’s life.

And as always we ask that you keep Mark and his family in your prayers. Thank you very much.+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Mark Howell 42 months ago Share We need your help!!! We are a group of people who love Mark Howell dearly. Chances are you know him and feel the same way we do. PLEASE help us keep the miracle that he is going. For those who don’t know here’s the background…Mark Howell is 32 years old. He is a husband to Christina and a father to Gabe who is almost two years old. He is a son to Steve and Toni and brother to Mike and Mitch. In November 2012 Mark had surgery to remove a 15 pound tumor from his pancreas. Also removed were his gall bladder half of his stomach the top of his pancreas and part of his large intestine and colon. Since then Mark has received various forms of treatment and another surgery to remove more tumors. He has been diagnosed with Stage 4 Melanoma. He was not seeing much success until he was accepted into a program at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville Florida for the trial of PD1. By the grace of God Mark is seeing positive results with this treatment. After the first round and scan that followed his tumors showed a 70% shrinkage. A MIRACLE for sure!Now we need help. Mark MUST travel to Florida for treatment every three weeks. Mark MUST take a number of prescription medications due to these treatments and the previous surgeries and treatments. These things are keeping our MIRACLE alive and with us! These things have an incredibly high cost. Because of the side effects Mark is not able to keep up a full time work schedule. His wife Christina is a speech pathologist and works full time at McLaren Hospital. Childcare for Gabe (when he isn’t able to be cared for by a family member) is another expense that has become difficult to manage.Now is the time to give back to this great man and his family. Without funds he will not be able to continue the very things that are keeping him alive. Mark has given a great deal to this community. He has been a mentor and role model for many of the children in our community through his passion for his hometown soccer and children. He has coached so many of our children and related to them in ways that many adults can’t. PLEASE help us show what he means to so many of us and help save his life.Ashley and Mike Howell Sandie and Don Cortez Barb and Mark Binkley Lindsay and Ed Koss Sue and Jim Gardner Lauren and Mitch Howell+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Mark Howell 53 months ago Share So last time I updated was about 3 months ago. Since then I have had a surgery to remove 5 more tumors and a kidney was said to be cancer free waited about 6 weeks had another set of scans and tests and received news that the cancer has grown back again and has spread to a small region of my neck as well. I was in the process of being accepted into the National Cancer Institute in Maryland as both University of Michigan and Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa Bay Florida suggested it was my best treatment option. Now with the government shutdown National Cancer Institute is not accepting any new patients because they are government funded. This was not only my best shot for treatment but many others in this country as well. The shutdown is taking away the opportunity of more than 200 cancer patients per week to be correctly treated at possibly the only place they can be treated. I am now exploring other options but no other places in the US offer the treatment I was to receive at NCI. Thank you everyone for your support thoughts and prayers. - Mark+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I just wanted to give you all an update on my current condition.I just saw my doctor. I recently had a cat scan done which I will be doing every 3 months to make sure cancer is gone and never ever coming back! Hit the road Jack! Well the Dr. said I have an irritated superficial ulcer on my tongue which doesn't concern him that much but he will keep an eye on it. It irritates me so much! It stings sometimes when i drink. (I think I want to try and have pureed soups and fruits soon). Anyways he felt the irritated sore and said it wasn't hard like the one I had that was cancerous so he said try not to worry. On top of that he felt the lumps on my neck that I was concerned about 2 weeks ago which is why we did the cat scan ASAP. He said they are smaller now and he thinks they were just Lymph nodes swollen as a reaction to radiation but we will do an ultrasound needle biopsy anyways just to make sure even though those biopsies may have to be repeated? (That sucks and isn't as assuring but what do I know? I leave it all to God).Overall health wise he says he doesn't think it's anything. He says in his clinical opinion he thinks I'm fine but because I had cancer and for some reason these cancers seem to be more aggressive in younger patients he rather give me anxiety and go through all this just to make sure that we are clear.So....that's what's up with me! Prayers needed! Always and everyday! Love you so much! Please come over soon! Or call! Or text! Or write a letter like we used to do in our school days. That was fun. I miss being young. I want to hear from you! Going through withdrawals to just see some caring faces! God Bless you all! Pray. Believe. Have faith! Spread love! Be positive! Smile! Live! Laugh! And God Bless.

We are home and doing well now though. The issue with this last round was IL2... it\\'s such a nasty little thing. It really makes blood vessels \"\"leaky\"\" and Landon really had a lot of leakage he was carrying about 5 extra ponds of fluids at one pint. It started to really mess with his comfort electrolytes and body functions. He made it though three of the four scheduled days before his doctor decided to stop it. We are hugely thankful to his nurses who know him so well and are so careful with him that they were able to lessen the side effects. As soon as the IL2 stoped he started to feel and do much better! In addition to the IL2 issues it is suspected that he has/had a possible line infection. One culture came back positive for an organism that is commonly found in the mouth. He was instantly started on antibiotics since he had a fever as well. My thought is that it may not be a true infection Dylan said that Landon may have sneezed at the time labs were collect so who knows. The important part is the most recent cultures are negative and we are continuing IV antibiotics just to be on the safe side. Landon has been doing well since we\\'ve been home and wanting to play outside since the weather is finally nice! We did make a stop at a store yesterday with him so he could meet a grizzly bear I\\'m not to sure how he really felt about it. It\\'s kinda crazy to think that we only have one more inpatient treatment round. Our lives have revolved around this for what seems like so long.

To confirm or rule out theses areas we needed to have an MRI done on Monday. There were many tears of fear and anger shed this weekend as we could do nothing but wait. Landon enjoyed himself though as his Auntie Taylor was here and boy did he wear her out. Ignorance in youth has been wonderful and Landon spent the weekend not knowing anything was going on. We made it through this weekend and spent the day at the hospital today as Landon had to be completely anesthetized for the MRI. After he woke up we headed upstairs to awaits the report. To our surprise we were met getting off the elevator by Landon\\'s doctor who was waiting with amazing news and hugs. The MRI was clear! The spots seen on the MIBG scan were an artifact and nothing to be concerned about! And his bone marrow samples were clear as well! We didn\\'t know to cry celebrate or pass out. This was the best news we could have ever asked for our prayers had been answered. We thank you all for your continued support thoughts and prayers they are working!!We start round four this week which will be the same as round two.

Brianne continues to be an absolute rockstar. She's even with her Dr's permission been able to come into the office and work a few hours when she's feeling up to it. Smh you seriously can't hold this girl down! She finished her chemo here @ Cape Cod Hospital and just the other day had a petscan. The results of the scan showed her disease free! So the chemo worked. Unfortunately she'll still have to go through with the stem cell transplant. But it's ok she (we) got this!! She spent the whole day today up in Boston finding out exactly what the plan is and will be checking into Dana Farber on September 11th. Please keep her and the whole family in your thoughts and prayers. We can't express really how much we appreciate everyone's support!!! Stay tuned for some exciting information about a awesome fundraiser we have in the works to continue to help with hospital copay's the extra expenses of traveling back and forth to Boston and hotel stays etc. Our goal is to try to get Sophie & Tim up to visit Brianne as much as possible as this will be equally difficult on everyone!

Essentially this means my transplant failed to achieve the desired results. What Now?

Dr. O as he's called is known as the foremost expert on Hodgkins Lymphoma and people around the globe come to visit him for his strategies to fight this disease especially in early relapse post transplant.

He takes his meds everyday pills with no complaint. He tells me when to flush his line and when meds are due. He can tell you what medicine put him to sleep for sedated tests and can tell you what is happening in his surgeries. He has kept such an amazing attitude through all of this. He knows he has cancer he knows he is going to lose his hair and he knows he will not go to school or do other typical things.

       " '\"Update 24 Posted by Geoff Masci 8 months ago Share Hi everyone ! I have good news! Monday I went in to SCCA for the verdict on all my recent tests now that active therapy is done. So...........(drumroll!!!!)I am cancer free at the moment !I do have to return for 90 day follow-ups but that\\'s a small price to pay for vigilance.I am back working albeit a little slow but I\\'m doing it. My mind has returned and I can remember all the technical stuff I\\'m required to utilize. Happy Day !!This has been worth all the hassle and pain and sickness of the Chemo Radiation and the lethargy that comes with it.Thank you and Bless you to all the people that have helped us get through this ordeal. I battled this thing for 17 years now and this last year was the worst. Thank you and bless you to all the people that prayed and thought of us but were unable to contribute financially. I appreciate your involvement too.The sun has come out and it\\'s not tomorrow it\\'s today.I\\'m still thanking God as much as can remember to do that. Life is a wonderful gift. It can be stolen in a moment. Cherish it now. The future is always now moment to moment.+ Read MoreUpdate 23 Posted by Geoff Masci 11 months ago Share Well...My first week of radiation has gone by. No soreness yet. The staff at the UofW have been wonderful to me as always. Saw my Radiation Oncologists Thurs. and was given a special imaging comprehensive show of the last two years of comparative imaging. It was instructive.My reprieve from cancer is real but subject to conditional caveats about its return. This is no surprise. They are proposing 90 day rechecks after the radiation is over in mid-May. This also no surprise. The plan is to prevent/eradicate/intervene in any recurrence in a timely manner. Good by me.I\\'m very \"\"game\"\" for life!I\\'m mentally preparing myself for work. My first day was scheduled for Apr.19th but no exams have been scheduled yet (which means that it\\'s unlikely any will be). The other thing is that it will take 6 to 12 weeks before any funds start coming in from the date of the exam performed/report received by the ordering agency. Oh well that\\'s the nature of the beast.All in all everything is moving along pretty good. I\\'m wearing my \"\"old\"\" leg. There\\'s a \"\"new\"\" socket on the shelf that we may attach next week. Or maybe if that doesn\\'t work we may go to a simple suction-style fit with a new casing. Wearing the \"\"old\"\" socket is kinda painful right now and although I am assured that it will become less so I\\'m a bit sceptical presently. My ambulation abilities/skills have not returned to tha levels that I had when I was a \"\"guinea-pig\"\" at the U a 3years interval ago when I was rewarded with an Icelandic computer driven \"\"knee\"\". Maybe that will return.I return to Seattle tomorrow for the next week in this therapy. I\\'m staying with Stephen and Michele most wonderful friends that really behave as family. They are just lovely.That\\'s the update. Thank you all ! Bless you!+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by Geoff Masci 11 months ago Share Update time....Friday (3/31) I go into Seattle to start my Radiation treatment. Monday they made the shields and templates for that now it starts for the next 6+ weeks at the UofW.I\\'ve been through this a few times so I at least know what to expect. The area to be irradiated is my left inguinal region (groin) again.As with all radiation you sometimes have reactions sometimes not. In this area I\\'ve had \"\"sunburn\"\" reactions to my skin hair loss locally(what the chemo didn\\'t get) progressive fatigue and some difficulties wearing a prosthesis.I \\'ve planned on working starting April 19th but I only have 3 days in April scheduled. May is a little better. My last day of radiation is set up to be May 17th. So far so good.I\\'m looking forward to returning to work but I have some reservations about my mobility and stamina.I also start with my prosthetists on April 3rd to start to construct a new leg again. There have been some changes to that UofW facility but I believe they\\'ll benefit me.I still feel a little \"\"punky\"\" but each day improves....did I mention that the IRS wants to audit me for 2014.All good things come at once !Anyway that\\'s my life all out in the open. I want to thank you all for your generosity and faith in me. It\\'s quite stunning you know. Bless you all at all times.+ Read MoreUpdate 21 Posted by Geoff Masci 11 months ago Share Today is Wednesday the 22nd. I went over to Seattle to the SCCA on Monday (the 20th) and had some more tests and a \"\"team meeting\"\" with my oncologists.They said the chemo and the operation worked !Cancer not there right now !Yes I have to undergo radiation for 6.5 weeks in Seattle but that\\'s a small price to pay for this good news. I\\'m scheduled to start work on April 19th and I have 3 days in April scheduled some in May. Hey ! I can do this ! I have to return every 90 days for tests \\'cause my cancer is of a recurring type but that\\'s a simple thing.I\\'ve also got an appointment with the prosthetists to get a new leg ( I haven\\'t worn my leg since the first week of August last year).Now all we have to do is live through this next 2 or 3 months until money starts coming in when the work \"\"pipeline\"\" gets some $$$into it. I suppose that I underestimated our financial needs but I was so embarrassed mortified actually that I had to ask for help that I downplayed our needs. But... Everyone was so generous that we were/are able to survive this whole time on the \"\"kindness of friends\"\".This resource is really super-wonderful for people in need my only caveat is that you seem to need a large number of Facebook friends and e-mail addresses to make it work properly and you have to update frequently. Or you need to partner with someone who has a lot of them( friends and the ability to update).I\\'m trying to pay-it-forward now  and help some others who don\\'t have this advantage. I urge all of you wonderful folks out there to do so also. For me this new techno-charity worked and I can get back to work after a fashion in a month. Others may not be so fortunate....and again God Bless you all ! Thank you so much for this outpouring of love and support.

Thank God for all of you and for all of your love!**Good morning everyone. Anne and I have been radio silent the last few days as she\\'s been in the ER/ICU as of Thursday morning. We were at a scheduled visit with her Oncologist when they noticed she was running a fever of 103. They sent her to the ER and had her admitted. We later found out that her steroids could have been masking the fever symptoms as neither she nor I noticed it. During the course of the day she progressively got more and more confused and unable to focus or answer questions and in the afternoon she had a seizure. Over the next few hours she had a few more and they had to put her on a breathing machine as she wasnt able to breath properly on her own and hooked her up to an EEG machine to monitor her brain activity.They arranged for her to be transported to the Neurocritucal Care Unit down at UCSD Hillcrest and we\\'ve been here ever since. They were able to pull out her breathing tube yesterday as well as remove the EEG headgear. She was still dealing with a but if a fever and we found out that she had caught a central viral infection that had gotten to her brain which is what caused her symptoms and seizure. She had been very confused slow to respond to questioning and unable to eat or drink on her own.This morning Anne said an entire sentence and her fever is down to 98.9! Still a little confused at time but much more aware. Still not able to eat or drink yet and in the ICU but we are making progress! Also on Thursday they did a CT Scan of her brain that came back with amazing results!

       " '\"Update 65 Posted by Kendra Bowen 43 months ago Share It has been 2 years since Jake received his bone marrow transplant. We are very happy to say that he is cancer free yet again. We give all glory and praise to God. We are happy to report that Jake no longer has to be on the immunoglobulin therapy. The drs are amazed that his body has begun to make its own antibodies as this is very rare. Most people are on this therapy for the rest of their lives. We knew God was going to perform a miracle and He has done just that. Jake is doing wonderful and happy to be living a cancer free life. We welcomed our first grandson into the world on May 20th and feel very blessed to be grandparents to such a sweet boy. Just wanted to give a brief update...thank you for always keeping Jake in your thoughts and prayers~it means alot!!!+ Read MoreUpdate 64 Posted by Kendra Bowen 52 months ago Share Well its that time of year when you are to be thankful although we should be thankful everyday that the good Lord wakes us up. I was reading over the posts that I have put on here and to say we have come a long way is an understatement. Jake is doing extremely well. He has only had one glitch that we are able to take care of with weekly therapy. Jake had gotten a test in September to make sure that his immune system was normal..well it wasn\\'t. He has what they categorize as \"\"common variable immune deficiency\"\"~ this is an immunodeficiency which causes an increased chance of getting an infection. The therapy for this is called \"\"immunoglobulin replacement therapy\"\" which is an injection of immunoglobulin that provides antibodies that he cannot make himself. Immunoglobulin is prepared from the plasma collected from a large number of normal individuals who have been screened to make sure they are healthy and do not have certain infectious diseases. The plasma contains a broad range of specific antibodies to many different types of bacteria and viruses. Of course the plasma is purified through different methods. The ig only provides temporary protection. Ig only replaces the missing end product but does not correct the defect in antibody production. The dr says ig replacement is necessary for the rest of Jakes life BUT we are believing that Jakes body will begin to make its own antibodies and he will no longer have to do this therapy which he does every week by the time we go back to the dr within the year. We know that the God that created this whole earth and raised people from the dead and turned water into wine can make Jakes body create antibodies. Nothing is impossible for GOD!!Well that is the latest update on Jake. He is back to working out 2 to 3 times a day so to say the old Jake is back is an understatement. Hes back in full force. God has brought him a long way and we have so much to be thankful for. I cant imagine this life without him and NOW we have a precious grandchild on the way that we will create many memories with. God has been so good to us!!!Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!+ Read MoreUpdate 63 Posted by Kendra Bowen 57 months ago Share June 29 2013 marks Jakes 1st birthday. It was a year ago on this date that Jake received his bone marrow transplant. The first year is critically important because it is the period when complications of a stem cell transplant are most likely to happen. One year after the transplant patients are typically able to get back to their daily lives with a decreased chance of transplant -associated medical complications. Jake went back to his normal daily routine quite early as he has the \"\"life goes on\"\" mentality.June 24 2013 Jake had his one year scan. The results came back as \"\"no evidence of lymphoma in the chest abdomen or pelvis\"\". He has a mildly prominent lymph node is his right armpit that is unchanged meaning throughout this whole process it has neither gotten bigger or smaller. It is nothing to worry about!! We are extremely happy with the news and thank God once again for staying true to his promise of Jakes healing!!Within the next month Jake will be getting his first set of shots to start getting his vaccines up to date. Dr. Kasamon said his bloodwork looked great BUT being that he has had 2 major illnesses in the past year she would like him to get the ivig to help boost his immune system once a month. Jake was not happy to hear this as it made him feel really really bad. We will consult with Dr. Abbott to see what his opinion is on this. Jake is really doing wonderful and looking great. He had what we believe an allergic reaction to the contrast when he got his scan on monday but that seems to be calming down. He had some hives and quite a bit of a rash. Benadryl is helping with that.So the first year has come to close....weve had our good days and bad days happy days and sad days BUT through it all we have had the support of family and friends. We will never forget the people who sacrificed a part of themselves to help us on this journey....First thank you to our oldest son KENNY for giving of yourself to make your dad healthy and whole and to ASHLEY for taking care of Kenny at his lowest point and ALWAYS being there when we needed you!! Second thank you to my inlaws DONALD AND EBBIE for giving us a place to stay when we needed it and being a big support to us throughout the whole transplant ordeal and to my parents KENNY AND JONNY thank you for not only taking care of my kids but for covering us in prayer. We could not have gone through any of this without the support of each and every one of you!! And lastly to all of those who supported us monetarily in thought and prayer or even sent a card or called.. THANK YOU!!! We love all of you!!!+ Read MoreUpdate 62 Posted by Kendra Bowen 58 months ago Share Just a little update...Jake is doing very well. His bloodwork came back today as normal. We are very excited. Jake will go to Hopkins on June 24th for his yearly check up. We know he will have great results.

After this cycle of chemo is complete we\\'ll be returning to a blood work routine of Monday-Wednesday-Friday every week at City of Hope to closely monitor Alex\\'s blood count.In related news from today\\'s appointments -- Alex\\'s bone scan appears to have no metastasis! YAY!Thanks everyone! + Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Kathy Young 12 months ago Share Update on 3/12/17:Hi everyoneI apologize for the lack of updates since August. Since then we had a little scare in November where Alex\\'s CT scan picked up some irregular activity in his lungs which thankfully turned out to be inflammation (similar to pneumonia) and was treated with antibiotics. Other than that... the past six months have been filled with check-up appointments in the form of blood work CT scans and the occasional bone scan. Being stable and out of the hospital Alex was able to re-enroll in school and take a couple of classes this spring semester. Our entire family is so thankful to have been blessed with these past six months of stability and just being able to enjoy living at home again.Unfortunately there is a new growth on Alex\\'s most recent CT scan on March 6th and we\\'re gearing up once again.Here\\'s a note from Alex:\"\"Hey guys there\\'s no easy way to say this so I\\'ll give it to you guys straight but my cancer is back.I found out on Monday there\\'s a new growth about 1 inch wide and long and located on my right lung (not inside) but under my rib cage. It’s grown to that size since my last scan which was December. We haven’t gotten a radiologist or my surgeon to look at the scan yet but we need their opinion on how to proceed on whether if it’ll be two cycles of chemo or surgery first.I’m scheduled to go back to the hospital next Monday for an echocardiogram (checking heart condition) and bone scan possible admission too. I’ll have more info after this coming Monday.\"\"We\\'ll try to keep everyone updated once we learn more after tomorrow\\'s appointment.

       " \"Update 22 Posted by Angela Comstock 24 months ago Share 22 Update - CANCER SUCKS!!!! So the MRI showed that there is still something - it is very small and it may just be scar tissue but they can't tell for sure. So Chris Dr. wants him to go to City of Hope to get a 2nd opinion from the Pediatric Oncologist. We have seen him before and the 2 Dr.'s have consulted on his case together. There are 3 options - 1 - do another surgical biopsy if they will do it because of the location to see for sure if it still cancer 2 - watch it and get an MRI every few months to see if it starts to grow - if it doesn't then it is scar tissue if it does it is still cancer or 3 - continue with 3 more rounds of chemo to knock it out but he may be getting chemo for scar tissue. The doctor is truly torn and really wants the 2nd opinion. Although we are both frustrated and disappointing it is still good news that it is much smaller and Chris is on the right track or even better cancer free. We won't know for sure until the next appointment. It is March 16th but I am trying to move it up if we can. He is making the best of it and enjoying competition season and getting ready for Nashville. Be sure to check out the https://www.facebook.com/LosAlamitosShowChoir/ to keep an eye out for how they do each weekend and see some great pictures.

Sorry that there has been a delay in the update to this page technical difficulties. Chris started round 2 of stronger chemo today. He is doing great right now - he has been asleep the entire time. This is the big stuff so he will have much more side effects this time around. He is going to do 3 rounds - 1 time every 3 weeks right now and if they feel it is necessary after that they may add on 3 more rounds. Of course we are praying that it is just the 3. He is ready to knock this out and finish his senior year strong and healthy! Thank you so much for the continued love and support! We love hearing from everyone. I will keep you posted as we go through treatment. Our love to you all!!!!! + Read MoreUpdate 20 Posted by Angela Comstock 27 months ago Share 22 HI Everyone! I wanted to update everyone on Chris' progress. He had a surgical biopsy on the 4th and the small amount that is left is still cancer and not scar tissue. After meeting with both doctors Chris will be starting full chemo next Thursday. Originally it was a more mild chemo that has a great success rate with his type of stage but it looks like it didn't quite get it all. As of right now he will be doing 3 rounds every 3 weeks. As long as he is feeling up to it the doctor will allow him to go to school and work so he can keep enjoying his senior year. I will keep you updated. Thank you so much for your continued love prayers and positive thoughts. It really makes a difference. + Read MoreUpdate 19 Posted by Angela Comstock 28 months ago Share 22 Good morning!!!! So sorry I haven't updated for a while we have been dealing with referrals and waiting over the last month or so. The good news...We finally got the appointment we were waiting for Chris is having an MRI next week and surgery on December 4th. WE LOVE THE DR!!!!!! She is going to at the very least do a biopsy on what is left to confirm if it is still cancer or if it is just scar tissue. If there isn't risk to his facial nerve then she will remove the entire lump or the entire gland. She won't know until she gets in there. We will have a final answer though and will really know what the next steps are. Chris is doing great! He has really taken charge of his nutrition and is working very hard to make sure that he is doing everything on his part to stay healthy. Thank you again for your on going love and support!

You are my motivation to fight. Feel free to share the new post! http://komonews.com/news/local/watch-as-santa-brings-gifts-and-gift-of-life-to-cancer-patient+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Pearl Rojas 14 months ago Share Holidays in the Hospital! It is quite amazing how fast the year can pass by. So here is a long overdue update on how mine has gone so far…March- The month I found out about the relapse. The news was devastating but the support and love I received from all of you made it so much easier to cope with. Treatment was started and we were on our way to a second transplant! April- Spent a good portion of this month in the hospital thanks to the side effects of the chemo treatment received in March. Found out that the relapsed leukemia responded to the chemo and I am once again cancer free ready for transplant number two! May- Spent a couple days in the hospital but was mostly free this month to enjoy life before the transplant. Had lots of folks visiting was able to enjoy time with family and college friends along with all my local homies. Thanks to all those who flew up and took time to make May a great month! June- No hospital stays! I definitely lived life to the fullest this month. More family and friends were able to visit. This was the month that my car was stolen…but found by me a few days later down the street from where I lived! Replaced a few things that were taken and my Archie (my cars name) was back and running. Went on a weekend get away with my mom to Leavenworth. July- Transplant month! There were no unrelated matched donors once again for my transplant. The transplant team decided that my best option would be to have a double cord transplant using donated umbilical cord stem cells. I had my transplant on July 18 ironically the exact date of my first transplant. There was harsh chemo and radiation prior to the transplant to ensure complete remission of the leukemia. Had lots of visitors and had a wonderful birthday. August- Spent a good portion of the month recovering the in the hospital. After being released from the hospital follow-up care is done at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). After transplants you are closely monitored by the transplant team at the SCCA. I would spend 3-5 days a week at the SCCA checking labs getting infusions visits with the dentist pharmacy nutrition doctors and nurses. Days I wasn’t tied down at the SCCA were filled once again with visitors and friends. September- Overall this month went really well in the recovery process. After a transplant there are many issues and complications that can occur even a common cold can be very threatening because of my weakened immune system. Another complication that can occur after a transplant is Graph vs Host Disease (GVHD) this is where the host cells are battling with the newly transplanted cells. Since the transplant I have been dealing with GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract.October till now- The beginning of October I was doing really well getting ready to move from the transplant team back to my long term oncologist. Changes were made in my medication and my body did not agree with the changes and I ended up back in the hospital on October 23 and have been here ever since. This hospital stay has been quite the roller coaster ride. One issue would be fixed and another would arise. I have spent a couple nights in the ICU battling bacterial blood infections had issues with my blood pressure still fighting off several viruses and the main issue at the moment is my GVHD of the GI tract. I started a immunotherapy treatment called Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) that is a long term treatment geared toward GVHD post-transplant. I am excited to say that there has been good progress and I am feeling better. Being in the hospital for so long has definitely taken its toll on my body. Currently I work with physical therapy as much as I can to regain all of the muscle and strength I have lost. I have learned that this healing is a process that cannot be rushed but I am excited for the progress so far. This is a very shortened version of my year I promise to be better at keeping everyone updated. Its hard to put into words how grateful I am for all the love and support I have received this year. It is quite a humbling experience to see the generosity shown to me through my battle. Every one of you are what keeps me going and fighting this horrible disease. I have truly seen that I am not alone in this battle and when I feel discouraged I think of all the wonderful people in my life cheering me on. THANK YOU all for keeping me going!

       " 'Update 12 Posted by Beth Anne Harrill 9 months ago Share Three years ago today Greg Germani was brutally struck by a hit and run driver while commuting home from work on his bicycle. It\\'s hard to put in words all the emotions that come to mind on this date. First I\\'m so thankful for the incredible medical care that Greg has received from Grady Hospital ER & ICU on that night and the next two weeks Shepherd Center and Shepherd Pathways for the incredible rehab care and Kaiser Permanente doctors for their ongoing comprehensive care of all of Greg\\'s needs. (And thank you ACA for allowing Greg to keep his care without limits.). Second I\\'m thankful for Greg\\'s extraordinary network of family and friends who have been there for him all along this difficult journey. Third we wouldn\\'t be here today without Greg\\'s incredible nurses who provide him care - Chris Pauline and Williette. They are the backbone in all of this. I\\'ll never forget that night in the ER and the words of the doctors who were treating Greg - \"his life and your life are never going to be the same.\" It\\'s so very true. It would be very easy to be depressed and bitter about the circumstances (and I\\'ve been there) but Greg is an amazingly optimistic person who is unburdened by the circumstances and takes joy is the things he continues to love - music photography history travel. I\\'m really thankful to look back on the past year and be able to say that we\\'ve taken some great road trips to Knoxville and Athens we\\'ve attended concerts grilled out taken advantage of our incredible van (thank you donor you know who you are!) and just tried to live as \"normal\" a life as possible. If you want to do something for Greg there are 2 things you can do: (1) visit. He loves loves having folks drop by and talk. Drop me a line and I will get you on his schedule. (2) Please consider a small donation to continue helping in his continuing medical care. https://www.gofundme.com/greggermanitrust. Greg\\'s nursing care is 24/7 and it allows him to stay in his home. Unfortunately it is all out of pocket as none of it is covered by insurance or Medicare. Thanks all. Greg is blessed to have friends and family like you and we are all really lucky to have Greg to remind us about what is important in life.+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Beth Anne Harrill 13 months ago Share Hi folks - I\\'m not really good at doing updates on Go Fund Me but I want to give an update on Greg in case you\\'re not on Facebook. Greg continues to improve and gain strength. Most encouraging is that his short term memory is improving. He can recall conversations from earlier in the day or week which is tremendously exciting given the severity of his brain injury. We\\'ve been busy - we spent Christmas with my family in Maryville Tennessee Greg\\'s been going to the movies weekly with his nurse Chris and he remains an avid and vocal vinyl enthusiast.We\\'ve also gotten into the crafting business. I started making Christmas wreathes last year as a way to raise money and lo and behold people liked them. I hated throwing out the unused album covers so I found a way to turn those into notebooks jewelry and bookmarks. We had quite a bit of success selling to neighbors and friends. I finally got around to setting up an Etsy store and we\\'ve gotten a little bit of publicity via Decaturish ( http://www.decaturish.com/2017/01/injured-cyclist-greg-germani-opens-online-store-to-fund-recovery-expenses/). If you\\'re inclined to give always know that you can \"buy\" instead if you\\'d like to get something that Greg and I have collaborated on.

Box 846 Atlanta GA 30301.\"+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Beth Anne Harrill 32 months ago Share June 28 2015 - Today was just an incredible day for Greg Germani. After Jeff Hullinger’s interview with Greg aired a couple of weeks ago I received a message from Cynthia Hanrahan Henry. Cyndy’s late father Clem Hanrahan was also treated at Shepherd Center a few years ago. The family was incredibly moved by Greg’s circumstances and wanted to make a gift to Greg. The gift is just extraordinary – a 2012 Toyota Sienna van with adaptable seating. Yes you read that right – a gift of a van. We spent the afternoon with Donna Hanrahan Clem’s wife and her daughter Cyndy and son Jim Hanrahan. I knew it would be emotional but once we started talking and discovering all the things other than the medical ones we have in common it just seemed to be fate that the Germanis and Hanrahans would cross paths. The clincher was when Greg mentioned his love of Ray Price. Turns out that “For the Good Times” is a special song for this family. We will be creating a lot more good times with this van because it really gives Greg so much more freedom during the week. He won’t need to rely on me for transportation; if he wants to go somewhere his nurses can take him. Mobility and independence are two of Greg’s overarching goals and this unbelievable gift will provide the means to achieve them. For all the difficulties of the past year I have learned that the good the truly great people in this world shine through and help you forget the rest. Thank you Hanrahan family- friends for life!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 3 Posted by Ashley Buckley 49 months ago Share A lot has happened in the past week or so. Greyson is back at Golisano after an E. coli infection last week. He has had to have his port removed and a PICC line put in because the port was bleeding and draining. According to his doctors the draining was good because it showed that he is getting his infection fighting white blood cells back but bad because it had to be removed. After 22 hours with no food or drink on steroids and Mommy trying to entertain him he had the surgery which was successful. He is now doing well and hanging out at Golisano until Tuesday when he can hopefully come back home. He has received 49 beads on his \\'Beads of Courage\\' so far signifying a procedure treatment or accomplishment in his journey! What a strong little guy he is. Lyme Central had \"\"Wear Orange for Greyson\"\" Day to support Greyson in this journey. It was heart warming to see the sea of orange and showed just how big everyone\\'s hearts are. In terms of his cancer Greyson is kicking butt! For the first time since his diagnosis on January 10th his platelet count is rising! I know the Trottier family is very humbled and grateful for all the support they\\'ve received. + Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Ashley Buckley 50 months ago Share Greyson is now home with his brothers and Mommy and Daddy.

Just an update on another fundraiser coming up to benefit Greyson: On Friday January 24th the Lyme JV and Varsity Indians (Christina\\'s employer) will be playing basketball against Belleville Henderson Panthers. All proceeds from the concessions 50/50 raffle bake sale and 1/2 court competition will go to the Trottier family. PepsiCo has donated water and soda Frito Lay has donated chips and WISE GUYS has been gracious enough to donate pizza to support Greyson! The community is wonderful! Northern Orthopedic Laboratory has also donated 4 tickets to raffle off for the Syracuse vs Boston College basketball game on February 19th. Come out and watch some basketball while also supporting Greyson! + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Ashley Buckley 50 months ago Share Greyson had his first victory on Monday when his spinal fluid results came back clear. The cancer has not spread! Greyson had his first official round of chemotherapy yesterday (1/14) of his 28 consecutive days . He is fairly uncomfortable from the surgery but has continued to keep his parents busy at Golisano with running around the floors! Tom and Christina are extremely grateful for the support they\\'ve received already whether through this venue or through Facebook prayers emails texts. You name it. Whatever donations are left after their expenses with Greyson they will graciously donate the remaining in two ways and split evenly between the Lyme Lights Relay for Life team and the fund at Golisano Children\\'s Hospital.

I know so many of you who have donated as of late don\\'t even know them and that brings me to tears. I can\\'t tell you how much this is appreciated. Hugs to all of you. ??????+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Alana T Womenrawhonestlovedproject 9 months ago Share In February 2017 after a total of 8 rounds of two different chemo regimens Jason\\'s oncologist deemed that Jason had hit the point of diminished returns with chemotherapy. Meaning it was going to start harming him more than helping fight the cancer. He began suggesting alternative treatments and homeopathic remedies in which he had already been consuming since diagnosis.SCCA was contacted to pursue any clinical trial possibilities. After several weeks of waiting for his tumor biopsy to be completed he was found to be eligible for one. He then began the battery of testing and after all was cleared we were psyched at the new possibility.However after a routine bloodwork scan his bilirubin count was high indicating trouble with his liver and excluding him from the trial pending further testing. It was found that since the exclusion of chemo his tumor had grown and was now pressing on his bile duct which was causing his liver to malfunction.The decision was made to operate attempting to place a stent in his bile duct allowing it to open and allow his liver to produce normal bilirubin levels and subsequently get back on the list for the clinical trial.After 2 separate attempts surgeons were unable to insert the stent as part of his stomach had been bypassed in a previous surgery in early 2016. Because of this and the fluid buildup in his abdomen the risk of infection was very great the surgeons at Harbor View could not successfully reach his bile duct.This was Jason\\'s final option for treatment of pancreatic cancer. He has lost significant weight and is unable to perform many daily tasks without assistance.Besides the fact that Jayme needs to be there to care for him she also understandably wants to be there to care for him and to spend this time with the love of her life.Being that she is the sole provider at this time this means that they will have no income if she misses work. This community has come in so very strong to help them this last year through all the struggles...can we please help them at this time to be able to be together and enjoy each other without the overwhelming worry of money?If you\\'ve ever wondered if your $5 will go to a good place in a fundraising campaign this is your time. These are people who love and deserve love. They pay it forward and surround others with love and support.

       " \"Update 6 Posted by Yudhisthira Dasa 3 months ago Share November 2017 Gunagrahi Maharaja Health UpdateDear devotees friends and well-wellwishersPlease accept my obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.Gunagrahi Maharaja continues living in Vrndavana Dham and is absorbed in the kirtan and Krishna katha. He is in very good spirits and is very grateful to all of you for your friendship good wishes contributions and blessings. He is also extremely grateful to His Holiness Giriraja Maharaja for the generous use of his ashram in Vrndavana.On November 18th Gunagrahi Maharaja had his scheduled blood test and the results were excellent. This indicates that both the allopathic and the ayurvedic medicines are having a very positive effect on his body and for the time being the cancer is not spreading. Because of these encouraging test results the oncologists and ayurvedic doctors both recommend he continue all treatments.The allopathic palliative medicine will eventually quit working. The hope is by the time that happens the ayurvedic medicine alone will have the potency to continue keeping the cancer from spreading.Presently Maharaja is feeling some pain and discomfort but under normal circumstances he does not have to use painkillers. He is unable to walk but can move short distances on crutches. Most importantly by Krsna's mercy he has sufficient energy to participate actively in the nightly kirtan programs which he has hosted for the past year and a half. These enlivening kirtans along with the love and concern of the devotees sustains Maharaja’s enthusiasm and keeps his spirits lifted during this extremely challenging period of his life.Maharaja's medical expenditures are challenging. His allopathic medicine is costly at $1800 per month which is currently the lowest price available worldwide. His other expenses including prasadam utilities transportation other medicines Deity worship and essential household items brings his monthly expenses to $3500.Maharaja wishes to express his deep gratitude to all his disciples friends and well-wishers for their care and support throughout the last couple years. He always looks forward to seeing those who are able to visit him in Vrindavana and to thank them personally. If anyone would like to connect with Maharaja he would love to hear from you through WhatsApp at +91 95 934 8119.Yours servantYudhisthira DasaVrndavana Nightly Kirtan + Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Yudhisthira Dasa 24 months ago Share Update #6Bangalore IndiaWritten by Gandharvika dd(The Update in Spanish is shown after the English Update)Dear Devotees family and well wishersAfter hearing from the radiologist regarding the increase ofthe cancer from the last MRI to this present one and taking into consideration the increase of pain and discomfort Maharaja has been feeling mainly in the right hip he has decided to combine hormone therapy with his naturoterapic regime. He did not want to take the chance of becoming increasingly debilitated by only continuing his present course and has opted fortolerating the side effects of hormone therapy.After discussing the MRI results further with the doctors it was discovered that that the size of the tumor had increased by 1 cm in periphery and the involvement of cancer in the pelvic area has increased by 40% on the right hand side and 25% in total. It is affecting only the ischium bone currently which makes up 25% of the pelvic area.The rest remains in good condition.This is what is causing the most discomfort and pain for Maharaja making it difficult for him to move. For this reason he will begin with the hormone therapy which is often effective in reducing the growth of tumors and stopping the spread of prostate cancer. He will receive an injection every 3 months. It will take a few weeks before Maharaja will see results.Fortunately there has been no increase or spreading of the cancer to any other areas of the body or where the cancer is presently such as the lungs and lymphnodes.Maharaja is in good consciousness and receiving association of senior devotees daily. He is very grateful for all the love and support being expressed worldwide.Your servantGandharvika devi dasi-------------------------Actualizacion #6Bangalore IndiaEscrito por Gandharvika ddQueridos devotos familiares y simpatizantesdespués de escuchar al radiólogo en relación con el aumento del cáncer de la última resonancia magnética para el presente y teniendo en consideración el incremento del dolor y el malestar que Maharaja ha estado sintiendo sobre todo en la cadera derecha ha decidido combinar la terapia hormonal con su régimen de Naturoterapia.No quiere correr el riesgo de estar cada vez más debilitado por continuar con su curso actual y ha optado por tolerar los efectos secundarios de la terapia hormonal.Después de discutir los resultados de la MRI aún más con los médicos se descubrió que que el tamaño del tumor había aumentado en un 1 cm de periferia y la implicación del cáncer en el área pélvica se ha incrementado en un 40% en el lado derecho y un 25% en total . Actualmente está afectando sólo al hueso isquión que constituye el 25% del área de la pelvis. El resto se mantiene en buenas condiciones.Esto es lo que está causando más molestias y dolor Maharaja haciendo difícil que se mueva. Por esta razón comenzará con la terapia hormonal que es a menudo eficaz en la reducción del crecimiento de tumores y para detener la propagación del cáncer de próstata. Él recibirá una inyección cada 3 meses. Llevará un par de semanas antes de que Maharaja vea resultados.Afortunadamente no ha habido ningún aumento o propagación del cáncer a otras áreas del cuerpo o desde donde el cáncer está en la actualidad tales como los pulmones y ganglios linfáticos. Maharaja está en buena conciencia y la recibiendo la asociación diaria de devotos mayores. Él está muy agradecido por todo el amor y apoyo que es expresado en todo el mundo.Su sirvienteGandharvika devi dasiRecent Visitors+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Yudhisthira Dasa 25 months ago Share UPDATE ON MAHARAJA'S HEALTH (Spanish update follows the English Update)I just returned from Bangalore where I was able to spend the day with His Holiness Gunagrahi Maharaja and the team of devotees caring for him.Maharaja is following a very strict daily regimen of herbal remedies and other bodily treatments. He was in very good spirits and eager to here all the good wishes and news of the devotees. Although he looked great and was feeling optimistic about life he has been experiencing some discomfort from the tumor near his spine. He is supposed to experience the healing impact of the treatments after about two months. So for now the tumor has not changed much. Once again it is uncomfortable to walk and spend long periods of time sitting up.The devotees are serving him with so much love and dedication he is having all his needs met and able to concentrate on hearing and chanting. It is so admirable how they have set aside all their personal and material ambitions to wholeheartedly care for Maharaja. They have set up a sweet little altar of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai which I have included some photos. Ajamil and Radha Prabhus are visiting him now. Ajamil Prabhu and Maharaja have traveled the past eight years together chanting and inspiring the devotees all over the world. They share a very intimate cheerful and loving relationship so it's very uplifting association for everyone.I shared with Maharaja a few videos from devotees offering good wishes and Hari bols. He liked that very much and encouraged me to continue sharing those with him. If you would like to record a short 30 second video just a short greeting and send that to me I can pass it along to his servant. If it is larger than 30 seconds I WILL NOT be able to send it. Also please do not send it to him directly as it is difficult and extremely draining for him to be online extended periods of time. Please only include positive short words which do not require a response.Of course again he expressed how grateful he is to the community of devotees family and well wishers who have expressed their love in various ways and continue to follow his progress. He's hoping to be in your association again one day soon.Your servant Gandharvika devi dasi---------------------------Reporte #3 Bangalore IndiaHe llegado recién de Bangalore donde pude pasar el día con Su Santidad Gunagrahi Maharaja y el equipo de devotos que lo están cuidando.Maharaja esta siguiendo un régimen estricto por día de hierbas medicinales y otros tratamientos para el cuerpoEl estaba de buen animo y ansioso de escuchar todas las buenas noticias y buenos deseos de los devotos.Aunque se lo veía bien y optimista sobre la vida el ha estado sintiendo incomodidad por el tumor cerca de su espina dorsal.El debería comenzar a experimentar el impacto de la cura del tratamiento luego de dos meses aproximadamente.Entonces por ahora el tumor no ha cambiado mucho.Una vez mas le incomoda caminar o pasar largos ratos sentado.Los devotos lo están sirviendo con tanto amor y dedicación El tiene todas sus necesidades cubiertas y así se esta pudiendo concentrarse en cantar y escuchar.Es tan admirable como ellos han dejado de lado todas sus necesidades materiales y personales para cuidar a Maharaja de todo corazon.Han ensamblado un dulce altar de Sri Sri Gaura Nitay el cual estoy incluyendo en algunas fotos.Ajamil y Radha Prabhus lo están visitando ahora.

He will need to have a spine scan done on monday or tuesday and we will meet with the doctor on thursday.

Catalina has been undergoing all of her Chemotherapy treatments as scheduled without any major complications. She has been doing very well thank God! And also thank you for all of your prayers. As stated in a previous update Catalina\\'s family was required to relocate closer to the hospital in case of an emergency however because she has been doing so well her family is being asked to vacate the home they have been staying in. While at the new place her parents began major remodeling to accommodate Catalina and anything she may need and did not expect to have to return to their original home so soon so now that they are being asked to go back the house is being worked on and not ready to have the family back yet. If you are able we are asking once again to please help with whatever you can to help make the remodeling process speed up or to help the family stay in a hotel until they can go back home.

She received GREAT news last night. The oncologist called and said that all tests came back negative and so it does look like we are just dealing with the breast cancer in her left breast and lymph node. She will be getting the port put in one day next week and chemotherapy will begin on Monday August 10 2015. Please pray for peace as she tackles that journey!I personally am simply beside myself and so overly appreciative for the number of people that have reached out to our family.

You put a kink in her life...but to be blunt it was only temporary. You have lost your fight.We will not dwell on the chaos you tried to create. In fact as the days go on that chaos is being remembered less and less. By the time Hannah reaches adulthood memories of you will be near extinct.What memories we will have are the following:Family bonds that grew strongerFriends that never left her sideA community bound togetherIndoor fireworks for 4th of JulyFinishing the seventh grade with excellent gradesBeing a member of the JK soccer basketball and softball teamSpecial lunches at school with friendsCarving pumpkins with a group of goofballsA barrage of parties at the houseTeaching Hannah to face a challenge head onTurning 13 with all her friendsMeeting new peopleLearning not to sweat the small stuffPlaying the last few softball games for Milltown and being asked to play districtsLearning Hannah looks good with short hair (or no hair)Being excited about the last two weeks of school (which is unheard of in children)...and all of the things to come...vacations pool parties sports sleepovers movies etc.Cancer do you see my point?

Laura is currently receiving week-long treatments and will begin another one tomorrow! Despite the strong and faithful woman that Laura continues to be these treatments are taking a toll on her.

It has been a very challenging month and a half and I am now so happy to say I have really turned the corner for the better. I want to thank everyone who has already helped me make it to this point of my healing journey. I’ve been learning so much from this experience and I recognized that I have been incredibly blessed and supported by all of you. It has been a very trying and expensive experience. I have been on a dedicated healing path living with my family on the Hawaiian island of Maui. In the past 2 months I have overcome pain sickness fears and doubts. My family and I are living at a beautiful healing temple with an old friend in Haiku. This place is magic and for the first time since my diagnosis I feel that I have really found a place where I can let down my guard and find a true place of rest and stillness. The peace of this place is having a great effect on me and I can feel myself healing every day I am here. My pain level has greatly decreased and my energy and positivity have returned. I hope that soon my voice will return and I will be able to speak again. Instead of chemotherapy and radiation I have been doing a focused program of diet rest Alkalizing the body hyperthermia biomagnetic bed THC/CBD oil bloodwoork and massive nutritional supplements. I have been doing regular Reki massage sessions emotional release work ultrasound therapy ocean and nature time green coffee enemas High doses of raw tumeric juice Dragon’s blood oil  DMSO  coconuts and Noni fruit and exercise. I have also been sitting with a plant shaman and taking Ayawasca medicine as part of my healing journey. It’s been profound and extremely helpful.It feels incredible and empowering to feel myself healing daily. I want to be able to afford to stay for another month at this incredible healing temple space on Maui and I need to raise another $4000 to afford another month plus of housing food and healing therapies. I am looking for 40 people to contribute $100. If you contribute $100 I will also personally give you a foot massage. I ask that you share this post and donate what you can. It all comes back around.

Today I am hoping to buy the clinic's anti cancer take home package of many different medicines stem cell vaccines specific to my blood a small ultrasound device and the special anti tumor elixir that is also needed for use with the ultrasound. All in all I need to rally up $5000 today to pay for it. Crazy I know. These treatment have been saving my life but it has been an exorbitantly expensive process.

Thank you so much for your grace and assistance.I wanted to tell you of the progress of my holistic/alternative cancer treatments. It's been tricky period of faith and focus in the past several weeks and I really haven’t had a clear way to quantify my progress until now. I have been in Tijuana Mexico for more than 5 weeks at an alternative cancer treatment clinic. I have been on a mission to totally heal myself in every way but especially of a stage 4 cancer diagnosis of a tumor in my left vocal chord. After 4 plus weeks of focused and rigorous treatments fasting and meditation I have received my results from a recent ct scan of my body. I'm happy to share that the treatments are working! The tumor in my vocal chord has shrunk in size by 30% and has changed shape with his indicates that it is dying. More good news is that the tumor has withdrawn (it was penetrating into the cartilage of my adam's apple and reaching to my right vocal chord). It is now only a smaller localized tumor in the left vocal chord. This means that I have effectively gone from a stage 4 diagnoses to a stage 3! This is major. It shows I am in remission as opposed to the tumor growing and threatening other parts of my body. I was so happy to get this great news that I started crazy dancing like Elaine from Seinfeld. I must admit that recently it has been a frightening period leading up to this good news. I have had major discomfort swallowing and in my throat as well as a complete loss of my speaking voice. I was terrified that I might be getting worse but the opposite is true. My doctor told me that the pain is most due to the fact that the tumor is under attack. The fact the the tumor is irritated and inflamed is a good thing. My doctor here is recommending 6-8 weeks more of full treatments in addition to my previous 5 weeks. This sounds like the thing to do but it would be significantly more expensive than the 6 weeks I was initially planning for. I will need to raise another $40000 ( in addition to what has previously been raised) to be able to afford all the recommended treatments. This sounds a bit intimidating but I am confident. I feel the whole universe helping me. That is one of the biggest lessons I am learning. That in itself is deeply healing. I'm glad I am able to do this healing without taking poisonous chemotherapy or radiation treatments. I am healthy and have no negative side effects from the holistic treatments. I owe so much gratitude and service to all of you who have helped me reached out to me prayed for me and donated to my healing fund. I really could not have done this without your incredible support. It's been a truly amazing experience to see my community rally to save my life. It's been so humbling to reveal this illness to my community and so healing to let the outpouring of concern and support into my life. In many ways this issue of facing my mortality and vulnerability has been a real gift. It's transforming me. I think for the better. All of this experience is breaking my heart wide open and has me praying for the ways I can can achieve total healing so that I can give back to others and the world all the healing and support that I am being blessed with. Please let me know how I can help you in the future.I am having my new album being mastered in the coming week and I will be sending that out soon. I'm really excited to share this album as I have been working on it for years.If you would like to contact me please do so by email at:Blanelyon1@me.comPlease continue to hold me in your prayers and if possible share my gofundme campaign to help reach the goal.With gratitudeBlane Lyon+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I’m happy to report that I have been getting better but I am absolutely devastated to report that Barry now faces his own cancer diagnosis (the #1 reason for my delayed response). Thankfully his health insurance through the Writer’s Guild kicked in on January 1st so we are both receiving the best care possible at a significantly lower cost. For now we are enjoying each other every day and are incredibly grateful for the friends we have helping us navigate all of the madness. While I don’t wish this on anybody there are times when I can’t help but think that there are individuals who deserve this rather than us. The only reason Barry didn’t see a doctor right away is because he didn’t have adequate health insurance and he didn’t want to rack up huge medical bills while we were already dealing with my huge medical bills. I lobbied for him to go despite what it would cost but he had made up his mind to wait until he was covered. The American healthcare system really screwed both of us. Maybe the individuals who decided that profit over people was the way to go deserve this crap? Thoughts prayers positive energy etc. are all welcome. Questions psychic predictions a doctor who promises a miracle cure if you subscribe to his newsletter etc. are not welcome. Anybody who needs the details about what is happening already has them and the other stuff is just silly and totally useless to all of us.All in all we are doing well. We appreciate all of you and send our love.All the BestHelen Crimmins + Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Helen Lysen 3 months ago Share Sorry we have to keep moving the financial goalposts on this but this time it\\'s medically hopeful but fiscally unbearable.Helen has StageIV non-Hodgkins B Cell Lymphoma. That\\'s as bad a diagnosis as you can get for that illness. The doctors proposed a new chemo combo that after the first course of this treatment is helping. Helen is again producing mature white cells which is major. So they\\'ve told her she needs at least another three months of this regime plus immunotherapy. The copay for these medications is $22000 a month.You read that right. 22 GRAND This is beyond all the other incidental costs of trying to keep a cancer patient as comfortable and unstressed as possible.We are overwhelmed by the kindness and generoisty of each good wish each donation. All that people have done for us makes us feel greedy to ask for more. Except we aren\\'t asking forourselves we\\'re asking for help paying off those very monied concerns that put profiteering before the human right of healthcare. And so we have no choice but to become mendicants who must beg for my wonderful wife\\'s life. There is enough indignity in illness this extra layer of insult is difficult to deal with particularly in public. But we have no other choice but to continue to rattle this cup until we can secure the possibly life-saving medications Helen so desperately needs.Happy Holidays! (Sorry Don).Thanks so muchBarry \"\"Helen\\'s Husband\"\" Crimmins + Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Helen Lysen 4 months ago Share Hello friendsI cannot express how overwhelmed Barry and I are by your generosity (I’m working on individual “thank you” notes I swear). I have been doing okay most days but the difficult days are getting a little more well difficult. Thankfully Barry has been extremely patient and caring. I get angry about the situation at times and can be a little cranky but we’re both doing our best and taking care of one another as we go along.Getting the news that even with decent health insurance the copay for one new medication is $13000 for a one month supply of new oral chemo meant to target Stage IV B Cell non-Hodgkins Lymphoma is a real punch in the gut. The $6000 copay for the other new oral chemo med made me wonder who is refereeing this match. But you all have been amazing and made a huge impact on easing the added stress of dealing with the financial side of cancer in the United States.For now things are looking up. I’ve started the aforementioned latest round of oral chemotherapy. It can be brutal but Zofran an antiemetic (anti-nausea) medication has been a good friend despite the unwelcome side effect of massive headaches that keep me awake. Barry Alfie the dog Dagmar Greta and Cookies the cats keep me smiling and laughing.I felt pretty well today so I dragged Barry out to go pumpkin and apple picking. We made it as far as the pumpkins (Barry said he had a line on where they sell pre-picked apples). I’ll get him into the Autumn spirit if it’s the last thing I do! I’m kidding of course. Being the wonderful person he is he happily squired me to a lovely pumpkin patch and helped me pick out some real beauties. He even reminded me to NOT try to pet the rooster that was wandering around near us. Country boys occasionally come in handy.And of course as many of you know Robin Ince has been an amazing friend and ally during this trying time. For those of you who don’t know he has organized a wonderful event (I so wish I could be there—the lineup is outstanding!) to help raise money for us and for CLIC Sargent an organization that helps children with cancer. So if you see him around give him a huge hug from us or give him a shoutout on Twitter (@robinince). He deserves so much for everything that he has done. You all deserve so much for all that you have done. If you can make it to the show...do it!http://cosmicshambles.com/articles/features/anothermessagefrombarryhttp://www.clicsargent.org.uk/I will try to be better about updating this page more and sending out punctual “thank you” messages to all of you lovely people out there. Life can get busy but you all are in my heart and mind every day.With much love and gratitudeHelen Crimmins+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Helen Lysen 7 months ago Share Barry Crimmins here. As you may know Helen and I are engaged. I cannot believe my good fortune.I came out to Greater Chicago to help her earlier this year simply because we were friends and I didn’t want her to face any more travail alone. Our love came as a surprise to both of us one that has already brought us great happiness.We planned to get married when Helen got through her last bout with cancer. We expected the docs to clear her. That’s not what happened and so my darling faces continued health challenges. Anything beyond that is our business and we thank you in advance for respecting our privacy.Since this is America most of the burden for this falls upon us. The comedian family-leave plan just isn’t what it should be— like in existence. we have decided to renew Helen’s gofundme page because she still can’t work and the less time I have to spend on the road the more time I can spend with her. So if you’d like to send us something in honor of our marriage and love GoFundMe would be the best way to do it.Thanks and loveHelen and BarryPS- Watch for news of our wedding soon!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 6 Posted by Jenna Tovey 6 months ago Share Hello friends and family! We would like to update you on how Alan is doing with his Leukemia since he has been home =)So far he is recovering as well as we could have hoped. His blood levels are gradually improving and his energy level is slowly increasing. Although (much to his dismay) he is still far too sick to work instead he is filling his time with resting reading and walking. You can see in the picture he is reading a book from one of his favorite authors Rex Stout. We expect many ups and downs during his cancer recovery but we are happy to say that as of right now he is improving.And once again we want to say thank you to everyone who has donated! The money that we have received has been so important in helping Alan recover. Because of the donations that we have received and continue to receive Siska is able to take time off to properly care for Alan and the financial burden of Alan not working is much less than what it could have been. The money that we receive goes towards special food for Alan important medications and treatment. We could not give Alan the care he needs without you ¬– you are all part of our rescue team!With loveJenna+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Jenna Tovey 7 months ago Share My wonderful friends and family <3 When I experience Jenna’s friends our friends family people we haven’t been in contact with for years and even people we don\\'t know helping and supporting this journey with us it’s a light to my heart.Over a month has passed and I finally have an opportunity to personally share with you. I begin my story just before Alan was hospitalized.Alan and I were having a late dinner and watching a favorite TV show when the phone rang. Alan answered and I heard him say \"\"You\\'re kidding! Are you sure? What is the problem? There must be a mistake.\"\" When he got off the phone he told me it was someone from the blood lab. They told him his blood results were so abnormal that he had to go to the emergency room immediately (he had a cough that would not resolve and tests had been ordered by his doctor). Alan was told that he was too sick to drive himself and they asked if there was someone around who could drive him. When he told me about the call I was not completely surprised as I had been trying to get Alan to go to the doctor for a long time because I sensed something was wrong but still I was stunned to hear that it was now an emergency. We both wondered if the blood lab had made a mistake. I drove him to the ER right away. The hospital staff was surprised that he was capable of walking in the door. Within an hour he was getting the first of what would be many transfusions and he was admitted to the hospital. Very stressed I sat with him for hours waiting for more test results and we met with doctors nurses and technicians. Eventually we were told by the oncologist that Alan probably had Leukemia and was extremely sick. After a couple more days when all the test results were back the doctor confirmed Leukemia and started around the clock chemotherapy and antibiotics (three IVs in his arms for weeks). There was no time for us to review together the treatment plans alternatives etc. because Alan would not have lived long enough for us to talk or experiment. They expected that he could die any moment from system failure. Alan was so sick. His hands were like ice for days his skin had no color - white as snow - and he was shaking. In this condition he went into chemotherapy which drained the little vitality that he had left. Within three weeks he lost over 20 pounds.He is home now and needing 100% care and rest. His system is so vulnerable he cannot have guests. I am driving him to his weekly tests and doctor appointments as his body slowly stabilizes so that he can begin to recover. All his body systems are weak and have to find a way to balance again.We are so grateful to all of you for your support and for those who are helping us using GoFundMe emails Facebook phone calls and bringing us cooked meals. It is impossible to convey the amount and depth of love support and energy that we feel coming to us. We cherish the re-connection we are honored to have with all of you in this challenging time. It will take up to a year for Alan to recover and the help we are receiving from all of you is priceless. With loveSiska+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Jenna Tovey 8 months ago Share Hello and from the bottom of our hearts we thank you once again to everyone who is continuing to donate to help Alan fight Leukemia!! We are happy to announce that Alan has come home from the hospital =) In the coming weeks Alan will be doing nothing but resting! Because Alan’s body is so run down from the chemotherapy it is so important that he rests and takes good care of himself. Siska will be taking him to the hospital many times a week so that the doctors can check his blood and adjust his medications. Siska has been doing a wonderful job taking care of Alan! She has sanitized the house she is preparing his food according to his special diet she is taking him to almost daily hospital visits and making sure he’s happy =) With love and gratitudeJenna+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Jenna Tovey 8 months ago Share Hello everyone! Just a quick update on Alan =)The doctors are telling us that his body is now making both red and white blood cells. Alan has not needed a blood transfusion in 5 days – this is the longest he’s gone so far without a transfusion. We are told that he might be able to go home soon hopefully for more than a few hours this time!Siska continues to work visit Alan every day and prepare the house for his arrival home.Thank you so much to all of you who have been supporting Alan!With loveJenna+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

THANK YOU so much for your generosity and kind words of love and encouragement. I feel like this is the time Annie really needs it more than ever! She is struggling with a deep sadness from the loss of her past way of life. Her body is still very weak. The little things that we sometimes take for granted like going to the bathroom can be challenging for her.Annie has been away from home for almost 8 months!! When she gets home she will not only have to completely adjust her lifestyle she will need to make adjustments to her house like installing railings in the bathroom. She will need to be extremely diligent about staying healthy. It will be full time job. I can imagine that the thought of going home for Annie is unbelievable overwhelming!! I am pretty sure she has to revaccinate with all the standard childhood vaccines!! When I heard this it really drove home the idea of the new life Annie will be creating when she gets home.As I am writing this my heart breaks for her. I have known Annie since we were 21! We grew up together and will grow old together... just not the way we thought we might. Life has a way of doing that.As always loving you all so very much and.. thank you. Thank you. Thank you.xxooBeth+ Read MoreUpdate 20 Posted by Beth Flynn Gordon 2 months ago Share Happy New Year everyone!!From my understanding all of Annie\\' s blood counts are where they should be. She is recovering  but very slowly. She told me that she had no idea how shitty she would feel and it\\'s frustrating. She is exhausted and very weak. All to be expected as doctors say. She still has a very long recovery ahead of her. Every day is a challenge as it come with ups downs and with unknown territory.Patricia is taking excellent care of her daily needs. She is the cook the cleaner the line flusher the CNA you name it - she does it. Such a blessing to have a wonderful sister. Love you with all my heart Patti!!!This update from Patricia (Dec 31)--\"\"Annie\\'s recovery is very up and down and it is never possible to detect how she will be. For example - today is not a good day.There are some days she has no energy at all and can\\'t make it to the bed from the shower without leaning on me. Other days she seems much better. But always vulnerable.She needs help on a daily basis and because of this we have cancelled any visitors and caregivers till the end of January.Also - Annie cannot have any surprise visits from anyone at this time. She rarely texts anymore in order to reserve energy.She is still very susceptible to infection and has to take precautions.\"\"As always Annie has such deep gratitude for ALL of you!! She feels your support daily and it lifts her spirit.2018 will be a challenge. We are up for it!!Love you all!xoBethPICTURE FROM DEC 17 photo credit: Karen SPICTURE FROM DEC 17 photo credit: Karen + Read MoreUpdate 19 Posted by Beth Flynn Gordon 2 months ago Share LONG OVERDUE update!!I was at MGH Dec 18/19. Annie was tired but in fairly good spirits. Doctors and nurses felt that the stem cell engraftment was occurring at that time. So far everything is moving forward as it should be.With Karen\\'s help Annie moved to Hope Lodge on Friday (12/15). The transition has been extremely difficult for Annie she is emotionally and physically drained. She has lost all of her hair now :-( and that really sucks!! She said that she was shocked at how bad she felt. It\\'s making her sad and frustrated. All the physical agony is normal as her blood counts are returning to normal.A note from Karen S:Hope Lodge is amazing. A caring helpful staff...beautiful common spaces. Fantastic kitchens (yes there are 4 and each person is assigned to one) with every pan and kitchen gadget you may need. Laundry and laundry detergent on every floor at no cost They have shuttles to hospitals and food markets. They have an art room game movie and yoga room. And Annie loves her bed! She is now getting real sleep without being woken for any number of things during the night at the hospital.She was quite pale when she got here and her color has improved already.Annie is still overwhelmed by all the support you are giving her. It really makes her emotional.NOW BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE--- We still need more donations!!Please remember Annie at Christmas time because bills need to be paid at home she has plowing and heat.. and the need for healthy food from Whole foods. Her disability has not been approved yet though we don\\'t think she will be denied again.HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALL OF YOU!!!

It was actually a beautiful experience with the blessing and then the music therapist came afterward and we all played music together.THE SCARY PART STARTS NOW... a stem cell transplant is a very complicated procedure and the chemo Annie had a few days ago will hit her around this Friday. She will decline and become exhausted. Her new cells will take weeks to engraft and during this time she is extremely prone to infection so we are not out of the woods yet.Annie had us all laughing so hard during the infusion.She is amazing but we still need all the prayers love and support we can get.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

It has blessed Mark Brands and Emma Sue so much:) I am not sure how many of you have been getting the updates posted by our father Bill Webster or the \"\"live\"\" Facebook posts from Brands so this is an update for those who don\\'t... Since getting out of the hospital after the initial surgery in November Brands has had to go back in for 3 different procedures. The first was to clean an infection in the surgical incision. The infection didn\\'t go into the bone praise the Lord. The incision was then not healing so she had another procedure to check this and clean the incision are again. She was in the hospital again for several days. The incision was STILL not healing so a couple of weeks ago she had to have a shunt placed in her back to drain off extra fluid to try and allow the incision to heal and re-train her body to re-absorbe the fluid being created by the healing process. She was in the hospital for a week and was finally discharged about a week ago. She has recently had an abnormal white blood cell count so she had a spinal tap on Monday to check this. They are still waiting on the results of this. Once the healing is done from the surgery she will have to start radiation treatments for the portions of the tumor that were unable to be removed during the initial surgery. Brands has remained strong in the Lord through all of this with Mark and Emma Sue by her side:) Because they are self-employed Brands is already trying to work as much as she can while she tries to heal and deal with all of the extra medical \"\"stuff\"\". OK... So that is the update:) Thank you all so much for your prayers shares and donations!! Anything you can do/have done helps so much!! I pray this update find you and your families happy and healthy in this new year:)! + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Brooke Webster 15 months ago Share Hello All!!

This is the second time Carson has had this and each time it’s so hard to watch him so miserable; fighting fevers chills unable to eat or drink and in such intense pain. Thankfully as I mentioned Carson was able to come home on Friday just in time for his birthday! He celebrated in true Carson style with an awesome Rapunzel cake! Carson is battling every single day. His bravery and strength never cease to amaze us. He still has a LONG journey ahead of him; additional chemo treatments surgery to de-mass his tumor stem cell transplant radiation clinical trials and immunotherapy.

He requires assistance to be able to walk right now because he is still weak and very wobbly.+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Chelsea Ochoa 7 months ago Share 11 Carson had an extremely tough day today. Just when you think it's the worst day yet there seems to be more ahead. Carson was very nauseous from his chemo and also had some vomiting. At one point his blood pressure skyrocketed to an unsafe level the doctors were worried about a stroke so they gave him some medication to help bring it down. At the same time his oxygen levels dipped very low so he is now on oxygen. His heart was racing like crazy and they discovered fluid on his lungs. His face has started to swell. He was inconsolable again today his mommy sent me a video of her sweet little boy just crying out in pain. He seemed to possibly have a headache because he was holding his head while he screamed. He should have received his second day of chemo at this point. Praying he tolerates it much better today. We did receive the confirmation that the cancer is in fact in his bone marrow.

       " \"Update 7 Posted by Melissa Lowell 5 months ago Share Dear family and friendsIt’s been a while since our last update and honestly it has been a rocky road. Danielle has really been through a lot these past months. To begin with a few months ago Danielle’s primary oncologist at Stanford suddenly left without notice and Danielle only found out when they would not renew a prescription for her. She was not told any details other than that her oncologist was on leave and would likely not be coming back. This is extremely upsetting when your doctor is your partner in your fight against cancer. To suddenly be abandoned in this way is jarring confusing and hurtful.Consequently Danielle has to find and start from scratch with a new doctor. This is no easy task. She saw a new gynecologist-oncologist a couple of times that practices in the next town over and talked over her history and some recent test results (which I will explain more about later). However after these visits he does not seem like the right fit and she is going to meet another doctor on Monday that has come very highly recommended.Next I have some mixed news. Since our last update Danielle underwent her chemotherapy treatments but had several sessions canceled because her white blood cell counts were too low. This made the process slower but nevertheless after going through the scheduled amount of treatments all of her tumors have shrunk which of course is amazing news! They can no longer detect the tumor in her lung and the two in her abdomen have shrunk a great deal. We are so grateful for this!The down side to this news is that while the tumors have shrunk they have reached a point where they are no longer getting smaller – which means the chemotherapy is no longer effective. Because of this her doctors have ceased her “big chemo” transfusions but will continue with monthly treatments of Avastin – a chemo medication which essentially cuts off the blood supply to the tumors – hopefully keeping them at their current smaller size.Back to the test results I mentioned earlier. In this past month Danielle also took a biogenetics test that compares your DNA/cancer DNA to other cancers and patients. This test gauges what treatment options might be effective against your specific kind of cancer and gives more details about your cancer. This test revealed that Danielle’s cancer is affected by hormones meaning that the presence of certain hormones cause her cancer to grow. This information was helpful but also upsetting. Since her radical hysterectomy Danielle has been taking hormones to offset the side affects of early onset menopause caused by the surgery. So the very drugs she was taking to help her could have been fueling the growth of her cancer. She has since stopped taking the hormones to prevent the affects on her cancer but in doing so has to live with the difficult consequences of not having hormone therapy to help regulate her body.But more than this information about hormones this test revealed the news that there are currently no available treatments that would be effective against Danielle’s cancer. This is obviously very horrible news.Danielle talked these results over with the first new doctor she met and he basically said “We’re going to do all that we can to keep you as comfortable as we can for as long as we can - and until a new treatment comes along.” That is not what you want to hear from your doctor and this is obviously upsetting saddening and distressing news. We are hopeful that the doctor Danielle is going to meet with tomorrow (September 25th) can be of more help and offer some alternative options and attitudes.Being the true champion and amazing human that she is Danielle is not taking this news lying down. She has decided to do all that she humanly can to combat this disease and live the healthiest life that she can. She has started an alkaline diet - which basically aims to make your body as alkaline (an unfriendly environment for cancer) as possible by eating mostly vegetables and other healthy foods and cutting out acidic (cancer promoting) foods – sugars refined grains and junk food. This is NOT an easy diet even for your average person not battling cancer. But Danielle has started on this eating plan and has already said she has more energy and is feeling better. She has also been feeling much better since stopping the “big” chemo treatments. She has more of an appetite more energy and her hair has begun to grow back. Secondly in addition to probiotics and other supplements Danielle has started taking CBD oil a treatment another cancer patient recommended. CBD oil has been said to shrink tumors aid in pain management and has the side affect of stimulating your appetite! All things we want right now!So while we have not had the best news at the end of the day we know that Danielle’s tumors have shrunk (and disappeared in her lung) and that we and Danielle together are continuing a strong fight. Danielle is truly an inspiration. I know she has had some horrible excruciating and desolate days but through it all she has been able to cut through the shit and approach everything with a wisdom clarity and matter of fact-ness covered in a positivity that astounds me. She is my wonder woman.We will continue to stand with and help Danielle and her family in any way that we can - and have done. So many members of the community neighbors friends and family and have stepped up with their love time and money and helped tremendously through everything and have made this awful process bearable. We are eternally grateful to every one of you and know that we could not have this without you.With all my love and gratitude for you and for my cousin Danielle<3 Melissa+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Melissa Lowell 11 months ago Share Hello! (I have some good news!)It has been sometime since our last update! Danielle has been through several rounds of chemotherapy each round a challenge and a lesson. Figuring out the right doses of chemo for each patient is a science in and of itself and seems to take some trial and error to construct the most effective and bearable doses. Danielle has been doing what we’ve been calling a “big” chemo every three weeks and then a “light” chemo every week.The schedule for treatment has not been exact because conditions need to be right before you can undergo the treatment. There have been weeks where Danielle’s white blood cell count was too low to handle another large dose of the drugs and other weeks when she was sick. You don’t want to knock out white blood cells when your immune system is already weakened and you’re fighting a cold.The “light” chemo is a smaller dose of one of the drugs and scheduling weekly creates less harsh side effects for Danielle. “Big” chemo is still a huge undertaking – time-wise and effects-wise - but I am happy to report there have been good results!!A couple weeks ago Danielle had an MRI. What she was hoping for was that her tumors had stayed static and had not grown. Well we are thrilled to let you know that the tumors did NOT stay the same size but they ALL shrank by about 20%!! This is incredible news!!As I’ve mentioned before there is not a ton of research on Danielle’s specific cancer because generally cervical cancer does not get to stage 4 and because a virus causes this cancer. It is a whole other animal when it comes to treatment. There are not many studies showing results from virus based cancers and the ones we’ve heard about have not always been the most uplifting to hear. So we are cautiously hopeful and celebrating this moment!Danielle is going to continue with her current treatment schedule for a time and then have another MRI and a PET-CT scan. PET-CT’s are very hard on the liver and kidneys because they use a radioactive contrast to highlight cancers in the scan. Because Danielle’s body is already working overtime with chemo her doctors want to be conservative with how often they use the scan. So we will see what the future brings with the next tests. I will let you know how they go.Otherwise Danielle and her family have been chugging along. The “Go Fund Me” donations have helped immensely with peace of mind and especially when Ernie has to take time off of work (which happens often when Danielle has treatments and afterward when going through the side-effects). The meal train has been has been a WONDERFUL (and delicious!) help letting Danielle and her family spend more time together and less worrying about cooking and grocery shopping. Danielle has been feeling pretty weak lately and has not been getting out too much so every bit less she and Ernie have to worry about is a huge help.I also want to shout out my aunt Terrie and uncle John (Danielle’s parents) for being super humans. They are an amazing example of love sacrifice generosity and patience and are doing their damn best to be there for Danielle Ernie Audrey and Greer! I couldn’t love this entire family more and am so grateful for all of them.I’m also so grateful for every single one of you who has reached out helped out donated babysat cooked a meal made a phone call sent a text or just sent love and prayers. Danielle is a champ and is kicking this cancer but your help makes all the difference!With gratitudeMelissa LowellKicking ass and taking names. + Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Melissa Lowell 13 months ago Share Hi all just wanted to let you know that I've posted an update on Danielle's Facebook page!

We\\'re going to get together at the Unitarian Church in Wakefield Massachusetts on Saturday October 28 at 3pm. I\\'m glad we were able to find a place in our home town and glad we can have the ceremony near Halloween which I think she would have liked.Here\\'s a link to the event page I\\'ve set up on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/112232569472782/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7DPlease let me know if you are planning on coming - it will be helpful to us to have a sense of how many people will be there.Whether or not you can come I\\'d love it if you could send along any photos or other memories you have of Elena. I\\'m going to be putting together a program book and slideshow for the memorial and I\\'d love to use them.Thank you again for all the support you\\'ve given Elena and our family over the last year - I hope we\\'ll get to see you in October.+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Michael Barsanti 7 months ago Share ...while I think most everyone on this GoFundMe list has seen the news I posted on facebook I am posting this here in case you haven\\'t.Thank you - all of you - for being so generous with your support. It meant an enormous amount to Elena and when I think of the few wonderful things that happened for her this year amongst all of the suffering I am thinking of you.------------I\\'m very sorry to announce the death of my beloved courageous creative hilarious irreverent crazy sister Elena Marie Barsanti. Elena died yesterday at her home in Hawaii after fighting leukemia with incredible strength resilience and humor for over 15 months.We didn\\'t expect her to go so soon (noone ever does) but she died at home in her sleep in her beloved Hawaii on her own terms and in her own way with her partner Angela Racho and her dogs.While Elena\\'s death is a huge shock to all of us and we all feel enormous loss I can also count a few important blessings:-She would have wanted to die this way and not in a hospital across the ocean from her home.-By all accounts Elena was so sick when she was diagnosed with AML in April of 2016 that she could easily have died right then. Instead she got (rather she fought for) another 17 months during which time she got to reconnect with so many old friends and family which was an enormous gift to her and to us.-She also got a little more time to create - to paint and sing. More than anyone else I have ever known Elena needed art to live and her art gave her enormous satisfaction and energy.-Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid (as they exist right now) she got very good medical treatment and she was extremely grateful for the good care she got from the various hospitals and cancer care centers. Elena deeply appreciated the care she got from so many nurses and doctors.There are so many people to thank - I wont do that here - but I do want to say how much I appreciate all the love and care that Angela has given Elena during this time - and those of you who know her will reach out to her and give your support.We will have a service of some kind here on the east coast to commemorate Elena\\'s life - I will post here with more details as they develop.-Mike Barsanti+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Michael Barsanti 8 months ago Share Hello friends of Elena!A quick update on how things are going. Elena has been in Seattle since mid-March getting treatment at both the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.Our hope was that the specialized chemotherapy that Elena would get in Seattle would get her into a solid remission and that she could begin the transplant process. That has not yet happened -- the chemo that Elena did in Seattle did not result in a stable remission but unfortunately it did trigger a stubborn fungal infection in her sinuses.I went out to visit her at the end of May and she was fighting off this infection at the time -- it has since started to recede -- but it has been a major complication to her treatment.There is some good news - Elena has been accepted into another clinical trial. This one is for a cutting-edge therapy that looks at the genetic makeup of her cancer cells to identify the chemotherapy agent that will be most effective. It\\'s called a \"\"Pick your own drug\"\" therapy model - and the best thing about it may be that she will be able to do it back in Hawaii. After four months in Seattle (and much of that in a hospital room) she is very ready to go back to the island she loves. If this therapy works she\\'ll head back to Seattle for the transplant.Your support - financial and emotional -- has been enormously important to Elena and to her family. It\\'s helped Elena\\'s partner Angela to fly back and forth from Hawaii to Seattle as well as with some of the expenses from their stay in Seattle.Elena continues to be incredibly resilient in the face of a very very difficult disease but I\\'d be lying if I said all of the treatments and the lack of a stable remission and the dislocation from her home and all of the procedures and hospital food aren\\'t taking a toll.If you\\'ve been thinking about getting in touch with Elena now would be a good time - though be patient if she doesn\\'t get right back to you.Elena and Angela are hoping they will be heading back to Hawaii this week but they don\\'t yet have final approval from the doctors for that trip. I will send an update when I know - but in the meantime use facebook or email to say hello!Thank youMike+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Michael Barsanti 10 months ago Share Hello Friends of Elena! I\\'m sorry I haven\\'t posted any updates in a while. I started out waiting for the news that she had been cleared to begin the bone marrow transplant process but that took much longer than anyone expected. The good news is that Elena will be travelling to Seattle tomorrow (Wednesday) and starting treatments at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. The goal there is to do some final treatments prior to beginning the transplant process which she will do at the Fred Hutcheson Cancer Center also in Seattle. Up until recently we had planned on Elena coming to Philadelphia for these treatments but as her treatments in Hawaii got longer and longer it made more and more sense for her to stay closer to home. It also helps that Hutch is a world leader in bone marrow transplants and her Hawaii insurance will work better there. It\\'s good news that she has been cleared to go to Seattle. There are still many big challenges ahead -- like being accepted into the Hutch transplant program finding a donor and then the ordeal of the transplant itself and a long recovery. But there have been times over the last few weeks when we all wondered if this step was going to happen so we are all relieved that it is. Thank you again for all of your support. I promise to not let such a long time pass before updating you again! And please remember to drop Elena an email when you can -- I know she would love to hear from you!-Mike+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I want to sincerely thank everyone that has contributed so generously so far.As an update Ellie is still in the PICU at Women's and Children's in Columbia and has been there since the start of this ordeal. She has had 3 of her 4 chemotherapy treatments and the final one is pending.Ellie has been struggling with respiratory issues maintaining appropriate fluid levels and keeping her blood counts up.Once she completes her final chemotherapy round and has recovered to the point of being able to leave the PICU we are looking into transferring her to St. Louis to the Children's Hospital for radiation. The Siteman Cancer center can treat Ellie with proton beam radiation.Due to the possibility of Ellie needing to be in St. Louis for 6-7 weeks Katie has decided to take a leave of absence from teaching this school year. Since she has tenure she will have a job next year but she will not be receiving a salary.I have raised the funding goal to help meet this loss of income in hopes that not only can we cover Ellie's medical bills but also travel back and forth between Columbia and St. Louis and continue to provide for Ellie's brothers.Again thank you so much for your generosity the whole family greatly appreciate it!+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Nell McCaslin 8 months ago Share Ellie has been in the Pediatric ICU for over 40 days. Some days Ellie progresses with her therapies but recently she’s struggled somewhat since her chemotherapy has kicked into effect. The doctors predicted she would become immune-compromised and she did develop a fever rash and cold. In the midst of treating her symptoms they discovered she also has asthma. The other day she had to go back on the ventilator to give her some relief and effectively treat her with Albuterol (her asthma medicine.) All these complications have interfered with her physical speech and occupational therapies but we are confident she will be more herself in a few days. She can now sit in a special wheeled chair which she has occasionally been wheeled outside to enjoy the sunshine. The physical therapists have been working on building up her strength and teaching her to stand on her own again. The speech therapist is working with her to make sounds out of the trachea tube to help communicate. Fortunately Ellie has a little feistiness in her natural character and appears to be the fighter her mom was with her cancer struggles. Katie her mom is sleeping overnight most of the time with occasional relief from Katie’s mom Lynne and Ellie’s dad Jack. Your prayers and financial support from all over the country and their local community have given them such an emotional boost. They are overwhelmed and humbled by the kindness of friends acquaintances and strangers. It makes it so much easier to face this challenging journey when they know so many are routing for them and their little girl.Ellie Granny (Lynne) & big brother Ben.+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Nell McCaslin 9 months ago Share Thank you to all of you who have donated to the Go Fund Me campaign.

Below is a little write up both mums wanted to share. Thanks again everyone... VACTERL is an extremely rare disorder; it can be so confronting and visual or silent and subtle. This is our daughter Emmilou at 20weeks gestation her reports came back with 2 pages of questions marks... Why is her heart disproportionate? Her foot turned in? And her spine bent and twisted in multiple directions? She has VACTERL association. She was born on the 14.06.2017 and has spent more of her little life in hospitals than out and her journey is just beginning. Her life will be framed by continuos surgeries... On her tiny heart and twisted spine. With no support here in the ACT and NSW my partner and I have quit our jobs in order to make all her specialist appointments spanning 3 children's hospitals. If you could spare some change to help us out with the little things to keep the roof over our heads clothes on our backs and food in our bellies: so we can focus on our little baby girl: we would be forever grateful.

This surgery will take place in the Sydney's children hospital. Emmilou's club foot has had 2 casts now the last one being a full length cast which will stay on now for the next 6weeks. This will then change to a boot and bar which will need changing every 6 months at $600 each visit this will continue until she is 4 and can have surgeries to try correct this.

It is yet early days but already Emmilou has a great medical team on hand in the NICU Ward at Canberra hospital assessing what medical treatment she will need in the coming weeks. Most likely this will be surgeries and on going physical therapy she will also most likely need a few trips to a children's hospital in Sydney for further treatments unable to be done here. The prognosis at this stage is unclear but being that Emmilou has a long medical journey ahead I would like to raise funds to help this family along as it is uncertain when Kirsty and Monique can return to normal working hours.

He had a little bit of nausea but other than that was just fine! The second round (March 27th) and third round(April 3rd) were better. He felt great and had no side effects. This week his counts are a little bit low. He is unable to go outside without wearing a mask but his friends are still able to come see him if they aren't sick. We are hoping they come up before Monday so that he can receive chemo. He still has his hair! He's noticed it thinning out a little but but not too much. He does yoga few times a week and works out too. His energy level is getting lower but he pushes through.Thank you so much for all the generosity meals support and friendship.

I cannot express the amount of gratitude and heart swelling of love that I feel toward EVERYONE who has contributed in every way!Whether it has been through fundraising Support advice or dollars you all have helped me to continue to BEAT CANCER! Although I am now looking at no chemo and no more cancer I am still recovering from a big surgery and we are still fighting hard to keep us on this track. Its still really early and there are a few new physical things that are of concern like My Lymph node removal and the beginnings of Lymphodema which i am trying to prevent post haste! As well as missing an extra month of work due to the longer than expected recovery time. We are also hoping that my first 3 month follow up PET scan and cell testing (kinda like a pap) continues to show no cancer anywhere. We reached our goal 5 days ago and people are STILL donating! This is incredible. Because of this we decided to raise our goal just a bit more to maybe recoup a few lost wages and to go towards extra physical therapy I\\'m doing to prevent Lymphdema from setting in that we are continuing to pay our of pocket for. This was a difficult decision to make as we do not want to over step or ask for too much. But after much thought and debate with my family we decided to keep the fundraiser open until we get our first big all clear from my Oncologist and cancer team and I start to get back to work as well as finish a round of physical therapy. We will not be pushing super hard at gathering more donations as its no longer emergent but it is very much needed. cancer is a marathon and we are hoping that this is the beginning of the end for now. I am on the mend and getting stronger everyday. All of this is due to all the kindness of everyone of you. I am alive because of you and able to continue to fight the stay this way. So much love so so much love. Thank youGia & Fam+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Giannina Mckee 47 months ago Share Hey folks! We are still fighting this demon. The battle may be won but the war isn\\'t over. We are so damn close. We need only like 110 people to donate just $20.00 to get up there! Help me continue this fight! It looks like I\\'ll be needing a lot more treatment in longterm care than we previously thought. Physical therapy and other possible therapies that we can\\'t afford. Missing so much work has also hit us pretty hard. I KNOW that the generosity of others has literally saved my life in so many many ways. But I am still struggling and still fighting. The littlest amount goes a long long long way. The aftermath of what I\\'m facing is A LOT. I\\'ve been hiding from it actually but I know it\\'s time to pick up yet again and keep moving forward. I am still on an uncertain path and still fighting Artist. So if you could share this and tell folks to go to the link on my page if they can or want to donate or if you can spare a cuppa it would help me slay more every day. The kindness of space on your threads and dimes in our fund makes me a better human and I AM eternally grateful. ????Hospitals ain\\'t cheap and I definitely ain\\'t easy. + Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Giannina Mckee 47 months ago Share We are so close! I know by now some of you may irk at seeing more posts like this. But we are so close and then there will be celebrations! Fund raising for my fight with cancer has been a very intense and humbling experience. There is no way to describe really how much this stuff changes you. At first going public was pretty embarrassing! And scary and unknown! I had no idea how people would respond. But \"\" a decision out of necessity is a wise choice\"\" and I can honestly say it has saved my life. Not only literally by getting me the best prompt care in a fuckered up system but from the financial burdens of having to settle for less. Also the amount of support positive vibes and encouragement has been mind blowing. It also got me in contact with two medical professionals who helped cut through a hell of a lot of red tape. Advocating for yourself is a HARD job. It\\'s also a 24/7 job. I spent days on hold and hours demanding (very nicely) to be seen. Although I would never wish cancer on anyone it has seriously taught me what I\\'m made of has shown me the compassion of strangers and truly separated friends from well people who are just nice to chat idly with occasionally. Cancer is scary. It changes you. It\\'s unique to each person. I am told over and over again that battling cancer is a marathon not a race. I know I will have many opportunities to pay back the kindness of my community but for now I am excited to bring this fundraiser soon to a close. No matter what the future holds. So let\\'s keep it going until that last generosity drops in. Please take a moment and share and direct people to the link on my page. So much Luck Love and Prosperity to you all and very much gratitude. + Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Giannina Mckee 48 months ago Share WE ARE SO CLOSE TO OUR FINAL GOAL!!!! Hello Everyone. I have been healing slowly but surely. I have two more weeks until my next meeting with my Oncologist and the final decision from the Tumor board about my treatment and what my future will look like. At the moment i am not cleared for work until I see my Oncologist and I am looking at another further 3 to 4 weeks out.I MISS tattooing so very much but also know i can\\'t rush healing from such a major surgery. Although we are waiting to see what will be unfolding over the next year My initial pathology looks good! We are hoping for the absolute best!At the moment I am adjusting to missing hormones and new Physical limitations. Recovery is a lot slower than i anticipated but i am improving daily! I cannot express the amount of help that this fund has given me. The relief of stress from the financial burden of ridiculous medical expenses on top of not being worried about missing work.This fund has also helped me get the medical care that i need and continue to need. THANK YOU everyone who has contributed or shared. To all the hard work that people have contributed. At first We weren\\'t sure that this fund was going to help but it has been priceless in the amount of care it has allowed me during this time. Cancer sucks but all of you are amazing. We will of course post once we know for sure what my future will look like. Again thank you.Gia + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 10 Posted by Dana Mahoney 2 months ago Share I can’t believe that it has been a year. On this day a year ago we found out Jackson’s leukemia diagnosis. We spent New Years Eve at home alone trying to process the fear and sadness. And today Jackson is in remission! He is more himself everyday....gaining energy wanting to create art and of course cracking me up. Recently they did a test to see how much of his stem cells were his vs the donors. And it came back as 100 percent donor cells! Which is what they want. He is down to doctors appointments every other week. There is still a long road ahead with physical therapy continued support for graft vs host and keeping an eye out for the bugger trying to come back. But we are so happy and grateful! Jack hasn’t worked in a year and likely won’t for another six months or more. And so many of our loved ones pitched in (and still do!) to help us. You will never know how much we appreciate you! Thank you for helping us through the hardest year of our lives! + Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Dana Mahoney 5 months ago Share Hi Jackson fans! Great news today: he is in remission!!!

He has developed graft versus host disease in his guts but they are treating it. They found a donor that is a 12 out of 12 match which is the best you can have. So they are feeling hopeful.

       " '\"Update 39 Posted by Dani Jans 5 months ago Share Hi! Dani here. Just wanting to give a quick update and reminder that our GoFundMe is still up and running. Jax was admitted to the PICU (pediatric intensive care unit) yesterday for incredibly high ammonia levels in his blood. Normal counts are 40-60 and Jax had a result of 400. The care team thinks it possibly occurred as a side effect of a new chemotherapy injection course he had started. A little background on ammonia: it\\'s a toxin that builds up often due to some sort of liver impairment that prevents the excretion therefore building up within the body. If untreated it can lead to brain damage coma and even death. Jax was treated and his counts began to drop which had everyone sighing with relief until he spiked a fever and his blood pressure dropped very low and his heart rate became elevated. It was thought he might be reacting to the medication to decrease his ammonia levels so that treatment was put on hold to see if his vital signs improve. It\\'s a waiting game at this point and poor Jax just can\\'t seem to catch a break. Kaylee had recently posted that the first 6 days they were in the hospital after his diagnoses had a price tag of over $34000 and they have stayed many many more days since that initial stay. The cost of Jaxson\\'s treatment is truly disgusting and crippling to Kaylee and JP. I know not everyone is able to contribute financially but I ask to please share this post and Jax\\'s GoFundMe page to raise awareness and maybe even raise some money to help out Jax and his family so they can fully focus on fighting this disease. Jax is strong and he is definitely going to kick cancer\\'s butt but it wouldn\\'t hurt for us to help along they way. #WeAreJaxsonStrong+ Read MoreUpdate 38 Posted by Dani Jans 6 months ago Share Update from Kaylee:I realize I haven\\'t done a full update in a while... last weekend we spent the entire weekend and then some (Friday-Tuesday) inpatient at childrens. We went in Friday for low grade fevers when we got there we found it abnormal cells were in Jax\\'s spinal fluid from his spinal tap on Wednesday. When they sent these to the pathologist it was reading a tick Bourne illness where they then assured us they were not cancerous. We were sent home Sunday morning after his blood work was cultured Friday night and after 48 hours was still negative. Sunday night Jaxson spikes a fever of 101.9 and the oncologist on the phone had to make the decision (after paging infectious disease) to treat Jaxson for Lyme\\'s disease. When we got there we already knew we were going to be admitted. His temp was already going down by the time we were brought upstairs. They put him on two different antibiotics. After having a meeting with an oncologist and two different infectious disease doctors they let us get discharged Tuesday afternoon. He is still being treated for Lyme\\'s and will be tested again when we go in tomorrow for our clinic. After being discharged we had our Centra Care appointments in St Cloud for a dose of chemo we were there Wednesday through Friday. Jaxson was great all weekend with no fevers! Last night before bed I checked it and it was around 100.1 but went down later on. Tomorrow we have our weekly chemo and physical therapy at childrens and then Wednesday through Friday we will be back at St. Cloud for chemo. This hospital stay was extremely draining.... luckily we got to meet a whole group of new families we haven\\'t had the chance to meet yet. But we also had to watch a new friend leave the hospital without their baby girl with them. We also got our first scare that Jaxson could have relapsed CNS only (spinal fluid). We are hoping and praying for a calm week for Jaxson. + Read MoreUpdate 37 Posted by Dani Jans 6 months ago Share Update from Kaylee:The reality of cancer fucking sucks. The chunks of hair that are gone the ribs showing from not eating and the bruises that cover his body any time platelets get low. The amount of times I\\'ve had to catch throw up spewing out of his mouth because he\\'s so sick. How a fever will never be \"\"just a fever\"\" anymore. That whenever one strikes that lands us a three hour ER visit no matter what. The fact I have to drill in his head that \"\"nurses only\"\" can take out the needle of his port. He should not know how to inject poison through it. Or how he knows that 7th floor oncology unit is our second home that he actually gets excited when we tell him we have to go there! That we have to entrust his life into the hands of his team praying no one makes one small wrong decision..... A simple target trip is something he doesn\\'t get to experience and even playing at the park is too harmful for him. We post a lot of the happy stuff and we know how strong our baby boy is and that he\\'s going to get through this. Jax is still so full of spunk and energy that some kids arent lucky to still endure two months into treatment! We love to show the world how well he\\'s handling this and that\\'s what we want to remember when this \"\"journey\"\" is done.

       " '\"Update 4 Posted by Danielle Fagan 5 months ago Share Hello everyone! New update on Jess!After taking a break from treatment due to low counts returning was pretty hard. Jessica had started to feel \"\"normal\"\" again and once you experience how chemo makes you feel you don\\'t want to go back! But of course she says she will do whatever she has to in order to get better. The doctors have adjusted the medication in hopes that it will increase her white blood counts. As of 9/7/17 they were still low but she returned for her fourth infusion on 9/8 and...IT WAS ROUGH probably the toughest one so far on Jessica. She had severe nausea debilitating hot flashes and couldn\\'t keep food down for three days. The side effects lasted longer than they had before and she really struggled physically and emotionally. There were days when she couldn\\'t even walk.But fortunately it has not all been for nothing--Jessica had PET scan on Monday 9/18 and got good news: The chemo is working and her mediastinal masses are shrinking! Her oncologist gave her two options: 1 she could have two more cycles (which is 4 infusions) and then have radiation on any remnants of the masses or 2 she could have 4 more cycles (which is 8 infusions) and not need to have radiation. At the suggestion of her oncologist Jessica opted for the second option as there are too many potential long-term side effects of the radiation given the area they would need to \"\"shoot.\"\" This means that in theory if all goes well Jessica will have 4 more cycles of chemotherapy and hopefully be cancer free! Again 4 cycles is equal to 8 infusions and roughly 4 months. This means if all holds true she is 1/3 of the way done as of now. They will also be removing one of the chemo drugs so she will now be getting 3 each time rather than 4.While this is all excellent news the downside is that this is FOUR more months she will be out of work out of income and laid up feeling crummy. BUT she is extremely relieved happy and excited to keep plugging along.From Jess: \"\"I am so thankful for all of the love and support from family and friends.. it\\'s not always easy being strong but each and everyone of you makes it possible. Off to chemo #5 tomorrow! Team Jess + Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Danielle Fagan 6 months ago Share Hi Everyone!Wanted to keep you all up to speed so here\\'s a little update. First of all the Yoga Fundraiser went great thanks to all that came and showed their support! And big thank you to Kristin for an amazing class and event and to all those who brought and purchased bake sale goodies skincare products and jewelry!Unfortunately this update isn\\'t great news. Jessica was supposed to have her third chemo today but her white blood cell count dropped to .4 this week after her last treatment. She is highly susceptible to infections with that low of a WBC so unfortunately they had to postpone her chemo. They\\'ve started her on a strong antibiotic as a preventative measure and she had to wear a mask at work yesterday. She will have to avoid groups of people children (especially with school just starting back up) and crowded/public places as well as even some fresh/uncooked fruits and vegetables. Chemo will resume next Thursday presuming her WBC becomes high enough which now throws off her \"\"chemo schedule\"\" she\\'s been planning her life around. Since Jessica\\'s chemo\\'s are on Thursdays she typically spends Thursday through the following Wednesday incredibly sick with nausea vomiting bone and joint pain mouth and throat sores etc. She then has Thursday through the following Wednesday of feeling decent/semi-normal. This gives her one bad week one good week between chemo treatments. Since they pushed this one back a week she will now be missing things that were planned around her \"\"good weeks\"\". As if she hasn\\'t made this the center of her life enough already she\\'ll now have to miss out on the few fun/good things she was planning to take part in. Such a bummer! This means she\\'ll miss the Hooters Fundraiser (hope to see you all there!) as well as potentially her sister\\'s baby shower her friend\\'s birthday etc. While it may not seem that big of a deal to some Jessica is very disappointed to miss the few fun things happening that don\\'t revolve around her cancer. I imagine it\\'s nice to be able to distract yourself with fun events when you\\'re actually feeling well enough so we really feel for her. Jessica is also eager to keep hammering and continue treatments so this news is overall disappointing.Jessica gets four different drugs administered during her chemo known as A B V & D. Since the A seems to be affecting her blood counts too severely they will be giving her smaller doses of it moving forward--which will likely prolong her treatment.Jessica is also now having to go on \"\"official leave\"\" at her work. While this is best for her body and health it is going to create an even greater financial hardship. She is also unable to change her leave even though her chemo schedule was just pushed back so she is disappointed to miss a week that she wouldn\\'t have had to. If you know Jessica you know that this is a girl who rarely even calls in sick and has worked non-stop (and gone to school full-time!) since she was a teenager--so this is going to be very difficult for her on many levels.I ask that you all keep Jessica in your thoughts and prayers as she continues this journey. We had to take a little side-step with all this news but will continue to move forward next week. Thank you! Hope to see you all at the Rohnert Park Hooters on Thursday 8/24!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Danielle Fagan 7 months ago Share Hi everybody! Thank you for the enormous support thus far. As we gear up for Jessica\\'s second chemo treatment we wanted to give you a couple updates.Here\\'s a few words from Jessica:Chemo #2 I am ready for you! After the first chemo I struggled for about a week with horrible nausea bone and joint pain mouth and throat sores and fatigue. Oh and my tips of my fingers are numb which hasn\\'t gone away! BUT my blood counts came back great which means even though I struggled with side effects my body was responding well to the treatment and we can move forward with chemo #2.I will have three more treatments and then they will have me do a PET scan to make sure the cancer is shrinking. I had my egg retrieval yesterday and the procedure was successful. Because of all of the support I was able to secure my future of being a mom which is so important to me! ??I also wanted everyone to know that I am hoping to raise awareness and money to help not only myself but our community. I want to raise enough money to purchase cold cap systems for the infusion center where I receive treatments for people who cannot afford it. Currently the systems cost $500 a month to rent! I used it my first treatment and haven\\'t experienced any hair loss yet.I love you all and am so thankful for each and every one of you! ??????-JessicaAlso as a side note I\\'d like to mention something on Jessica\\'s behalf. Jessica mentioned to me (DJ) recently that while she is so overwhelmed (in a good way) with support and love she often feels bad that she can\\'t individually respond and thank each of you personally for your donations kind words and encouragement. There are days after her treatment she can barely hold her phone let alone try to take the time to respond to each person. I\\'m sure you all understand and aren\\'t looking for anything in return but just wanted to throw that out there on her behalf. She is SO eternally grateful as are we all for the enormous support and all of the encouraging words. Seriously on behalf of Jessica and ALL her family and friends it means the world to ALL of us.I wanted to make you aware of a few fundraisers coming up:--Sunday August 13th: Free Yoga ClassPlease come enjoy a yoga class taught by Kristin of KO Yoga and Fitness and bring a monetary donation of any amount you can contribute to support Jessica through this challenging time. We will also be having a bake sale so you can refuel after class!--Thursday August 24th: Dine & Donate at HootersWe hope you can make it down to Hooters in Rohnert Park for a meal any time on this date! 15% of your pretax bill will go directly to support Jessica.

Seeing how we just had Mother's Day yesterday I thought that this would be a good time to give our friends a mom update. I spent yesterday with mom out in nature getting some sunshine and it was a great day. Over the past month mom completed a round of radiation treatment and is now resting and regaining her strength. The radiation process involved going to receive treatments everyday Monday thru Friday for a month straight. It is an incredibly exhausting and at times painful process both physically and mentally. Regina(mom) is tough and made it through even though I had to give her a gentle push at times. Thanks to you guys I was able to be by her side everyday and support her during the difficult process. Some of you probably follow the journey on social media and saw how estatic we were her last day of radiation treatments. After resting for the past couple weeks we're going back to the doctors this week to see how effective the treatments were and what the next steps will be. Hopefully she will not have to receive more treatments but if so I'll be by her side holding her hand and giving her plenty of hugs. You guys have made this long exhausting process a bit easier and for that we are both eternally grateful. Thanks for all the calls text messages information on resources genuine concern and donations. Love you guys!After a month daily radiation treatments mom got to ring this bell! Hopefully for the first and last time. + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Larry Robertson 11 months ago Share Hey everyone we are very grateful for all of your donations! Hopefully you all received the thank you emails that I wrote and they didn't land in your junk mail. So far mom has had two surgeries and as of today has started her second week of radiation treatment. The process is going well according to the doctor and mom is handling it all well. She still has weeks of radiation treatments which are five days a week and very exhausting. After treatment she's ready to crash but considering everything she's in pretty good spirits. I've taken her to all of her treatments so far and will be there for her the rest of the way. You all are a large reason that we are both in good spirits. I wasn't really surprised by my friends generosity but what did surprise me was just the overwhelming amount of love and prayers good thoughts text messages vibes and energy. A lot of you check in all the time and trust me everything that you've all done means the world to us. You all have really provided the boost that I've needed to stay energized helping my mom during this process which is more of a marathon than a sprint. Hopefully we're on the home stretch but cancer is tricky in that you really can't predict how long things will take or what the outcome will be.

       " \"Update 8 Posted by Lindsey Garrison 29 months ago Share 33 Hello all this is Leonard. I wanted to tell all of you how much my family and I appreciate all of the continued love and support you have shown us. I also wanted to update everyone on my latest reports. My third series of scans showed that cancer seems to be contained and shrinking. I met with another specialist from Emory yesterday. He said that we should continue on the same path because everything my oncologist was doing was working. I would not be where I am without all of you. Please continue to keep me in your prayers.+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Lindsey Garrison 31 months ago Share 11 A year ago today our whole world was turned upside down...BUT we are happy to report that my dad is still fighting as hard as hard as ever and is doing great! The amount of support he got was and still continues to be wonderfully overwhelming! We wouldn't be where we are today without all of the love that we have had from all of you! Thank you...for everything! We will never be able to express how much y'all have done for our family. + Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Lindsey Garrison 35 months ago Share My dad had another surgery today. After the last surgery (for the infection) they opted to leave his wound open and attach a wound vac to remove any left over infection. The wound was 16 inches long and he was attending a wound care clinic 3 days a week. Despite all his effort the wound wasn't closing as fast as the doctors had hoped. Most likely due to the size. The surgery today was to close the wound. It took about 3 hours but they were able to use his lat muscle to fill the space. He is doing well and resting now. We are excited to have this step behind us so that we can get him back on his chemotherapy!+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Lindsey Garrison 37 months ago Share My dad is having surgery again today. He has developed another infection. This one is more severe than the last one. It is located in his back around his surgery site. Due to the fact that it is near his spine the doctors have opted to open him up and wash it out. He will have a picc line (a longer term IV) put in so he can have extended antibiotic therapy. Prayers will be greatly appreciated today.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 676 shares on Facebook Read a Previous UpdatePrevious update You're on update 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Next update\",\n",
       " '\"Update 28 Posted by Michelle Ulrich 14 months ago Share Hi Everyone! I\\'m long overdue for an update so here it comes! Since I\\'ve been in touch the tumor in my liver grew to 11 centimeters. Chemo was not an option and neither was surgery (both because mainstream oncology gives them about a 3% chance of working and because I am done with poison and cutting). In September last year I started coming to Whitaker Wellness Institute in Newport Beach for high dose infusions of vitamin C and other cancer fighting supplements along with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and chelation. The latest scan showed that the tumor is calcifying! This lovely development did not happen without some discomfort as the cancer cells were dying. I got pretty sick and for a few days I thought I was a goner. Then the pain passed and I learned that my symptoms were common for people when cancer is being \"\"handled\"\" by the immune system. Wow! It was pretty intense but it\\'s all good now. I had a sweet visit with Mom and Dad in Texas and John and I had a precious Christmas and new year together. Life is sweet and I\\'m trying to remember to cherish each day. Here\\'s to a healthy and happy 2017!Don Nan Lori George (Dad) Doris (Mom) + Read MoreUpdate 27 Posted by Michelle Ulrich 24 months ago Share Hi Friends and Family!I\\'ve been very busy since I found out that the cancer had returned. PET scan revealed a lesion on my liver and a biopsy confirmed that it was the cancer. Following the discovery I had one round of chemo (yuck) and decided to take a break for the holidays and explore some alternatives. Oh but first my two dear friends Rosie and Kim went with me to Disneyland (and I talked them into getting annual passes too!). We stayed until midnight and had the most fun you can possibly imagine. My trip to Texas to be with my Mom and Dad for the holidays was restful and wonderful. Mom and I read everything we could get our hands on that could offer me an alternative to chemotherapy because even with the chemo the prognosis according to material posted on the American Cancer Society website is poor. I figured if I only have a year or two left I don\\'t want to spend it dragging a chemo pump around being sick. I\\'d rather take my chances with the cancer frankly! After searching and reading for days and days (while Mom kept me filled up with daily juice vitamins and healthy food) we stumbled upon a doctor who talked about a fascinating and completely unexpected drug that has been approved by the FDA for 30 years . . . for addiction! Dr. Bihari and others discovered that naltrexone at very low doses (3-4.5mg) boosts the immune system by causing the brain to increase production of endorphins (it\\'s a bit more complex than that but this is the short way to describe what Low Dose Naltrexone does). We learned that this little drug has shown some pretty miraculous results in patients with MS Crohn\\'s Disease HIV fibromyalgia chronic fatigue (which I have had for years) anemia Hashimoto\\'s cancer and a host of other illnesses that are at root immunological problems. There is a growing movement of patients who are finding out about LDN and are sharing their stories on the internet. Because naltrexone is inexpensive and low dose naltrexone is even less so and because the patent on it has expired there is no monetary incentive for the pharmaceutical companies or the FDA to study it. There are about 100 peer reviewed journal articles on it and several studies have been done on LDN and MS but few doctors know about it and those who don\\'t are not warm to the idea of prescribing it which is odd because it is FDA approved at 50 -100mg for treatment of opiate addiction and alcoholism and doctors are legally allowed to prescribe such drugs off label. I am lucky though because when I texted my family doctor about it he said he was already prescribing it for his fibromyalgia and MS patients! So I flew home and got my first 30 days of LDN from a local compounding pharmacy. Since then I learned how to make my own 4.5mg liquid using the 50mg pills so the cost is literally pennies per day. I have already experienced some improvement with the chronic fatigue (not every day but the good days are amazing). I\\'m so excited about this little known remedy that I have told everyone I know about it and as of today 8 more of my family and friends have started taking it. I can\\'t tell you much about where it is working for me yet. Today I went for some blood tests to see if there is any change in my thyroid levels anemia and Epstein-Barr blood levels. Next Tuesday I have a PET scan to see what the lesion is doing. My oncologist isn\\'t really interested in my plan but we have grown to love and respect each other so he smiles and orders tests and more tests pats me on the head and wishes me luck. Speaking of tests I have been embroiled in a battle with my insurance company which has denied payment for gene testing I had in November and has refused to let me have a PET scan. Their letters said that there was \"\"no evidence that having a gene test or PET scan leads to improved outcomes in stage IV recurring colon cancer.\"\" I suspected that they saw me as a \"\"dead man walking\"\" and that just isn\\'t going to happen so I got myself a case manager and voila they approved the PET scan for next week. I\\'ll let you know how it all goes but here is my lesson for this week: take control of your own life (and treatment) and never take no for an answer if you want something. Get it and don\\'t stop until you do. An LDN doctor in Florida (who takes LDN himself as a cancer prevention aid) said that he would move heaven and earth to get it and would not care who he insulted or offended to do so. That\\'s the attitude I love! So if you want to learn more there are a few websites out there but the first one to look at is lowdosenaltrexone.org. You\\'ll probably be amazed. I\\'m learning more every day. Mom and I have gotten every book there is on the subject of LDN (there are a few and one just came out last month) and my interest in naltrexone as an addiction treatment has been piqued through this process. Youtube has lots of videos and interviews you can watch for free. Just search for \"\"Low Dose Naltrexone\"\" and go. I\\'m excited about finding it and it has certainly given me a lot of hope. You can\\'t really ask for more. Love love love LoriLori Rosemary and Kim at Dland!The big boss+ Read MoreUpdate 26 Posted by Michelle Ulrich 27 months ago Share Hello wonderful friends and family: I apologize for not checking in for so long. I guess I thought I didn\\'t have anything to say. Life kind of went back to normal during remission--too much work and not enough Disneyland! So a couple of things pulled me back to reality. First of all my sweet precious friend Tamy Huq-Maxwell passed away from pancreatic cancer the day before Thanksgiving. She was only 37 years old. The cancer came with no warning and in 6 agonizing months she was gone. And now I\\'ve learned that my cancer is back. A CT scan and follow-up liver biopsy came back positive for more metastatic colon cancer. I\\'m going to look at it as a gift a wake-up call a reminder to keep the promises I made to myself when I thought I might die the first time around. Not everyone gets time to prepare for the inevitable or to have an acute minute-by-minute awareness that life is finite. We say it \"\"live each day as if it were your last\"\" but nobody really lives that way. There are too many responsibilities and too much work to do! And if you\\'re sick before you die you don\\'t have the strength to do all the things on your bucket list. So this time I\\'m going to let go and pay more attention. I already started with my Disney cure. So if you try to get ahold of me and I don\\'t answer right away you\\'ll know where I am!

       " '\"Update 10 Posted by Josh Sullivan 18 months ago Share 33 Good morning to all our family friends and Melody supporters. We have some news to share. As many of you know we had been desperately seeking CED treatment for Melody in the UK. However because of tumor growth and cystic changes she was turned down. Since the denial Melody\\'s doctors here have been working around the clock with the FDA to get approval for a single patient compassionate use of CED treatment. Early this month the doctors received that approval. We are very grateful to her doctors here and the whole team. It took a lot of hard work to make this happen. And yesterday our little Melody made history! She was the first child in the US to have this medication infused via CED. She tolerated the procedure very well. The doctors feel positive about how she is doing right now. However this is an experimental procedure and we do not know if her tumor will respond to the medication that was placed into her tumor. We also do not know if there will be side effects to the healthy tissues. What we do know is the medication got to the right place and that she tolerated the procedure very well. Over the next few weeks we will learn if her tumor responded or if healthy cells were effected adversely. Or even both could happen. But obviously we are hoping and praying that only the tumor cells are affected and this medication shrinks this thing. We feel very blessed for all the continued support and efforts from everyone who came together to make this happen. Thank you to all of you! Please keep praying her tumor responds and she continues to remain stable.+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Josh Sullivan 21 months ago Share 33 Hey Everyone:Sorry it\\'s been so long since our last update. We know so many of you caring generous people are following Melody\\'s fight. We have some good news and some bad news to report.Bad news first; Melody was denied treatment in England because unfortunately on her 6-week post radiation scan the tumor had spread toward the medulla and some cystic areas had developed. This was devastating news as all prior signs/scans were that she would be accepted to England. She is the only kid we know about that the tumor got bigger during radiation.Ok. Now for the good news. Since the denial Melody has continued her clinical trial at UCSF where in one month she has worked her way up to tolerating 3 of the 4 oral medications that they want to try on her. She recently had a scan done and.....HER TUMOR IS STABLE! The cystic areas have even shrunk a bit! We are so happy! Hopefully this good fortune continues. and this is a sign that these meds are working but we are still looking/hoping for a trial similar to what was going to be done in England.On another positive note the Make A Wish Foundation sent Melody and her family to Hawaii where she got to swim with a Dolphin. She was tired a lot of the time (probably due to the new medications) but still managed to have a great time.We are very thankful to the Make A Wish Foundation and ALL OF YOU for everything you have done/are doing for her. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers as she really needs them.+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Josh Sullivan 22 months ago Share 11 Hi everyone just a quick update. Melody\\'s scans arrived in England yesterday. We are anxiously waiting for a response from the doctors in England. For now we will continue to try and raise the money for her treatment in Bristol. On that note another kind person has offered to donate tickets to an upcoming Warriors play off game. If anyone is looking to go enjoy a game and support Melody at the same time here is the link to the tickets we are auctioning off on EBay:http://www.ebay.com/itm/141970505961?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Josh Sullivan 23 months ago Share 22 Melody finished her radiation a little over 3weeks ago. About 2weeks ago she started having difficulty walking and is more off balance. We had to restart her on low dose steroids.She had an appointment today at UCSF and the doctors feel like her symptoms are a result of pseudo progression which can happen as a result of radiotherapy. Sometimes it can cause the tumor to swell and actually look bigger on the scan but may be because it is working and getting smaller. However there is no way to be sure this is the case other than to wait and see. They do not think this should make a difference in the treatment for England. However there are some other changes inside the tumor. They said we should send her current scans and let the doctors in England decide.We increased the gofund after speaking with the doctors in Bristol and learning more about what the cost of the treatment involves. First of all we learned that they are \"\"exploring a second medication but currently the supplies are limited and the pharmaceutical company insists on charging an additional $14000 per infusion.\"\" Also she will need a minimum of four trips to England in which travel and lodging will be our responsibility. We have been overjoyed will all the help and support Melody has gotten and do not think that cost will keep her from getting this ground breaking treatment. We are grateful to all who have donated and will be in our families hearts forever. Thank you to everyone of you!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 5 Posted by Jim Aronica 10 months ago Share 11 *****UPDATE****** 4/14/17 Emergency****So far the trips to Houston have been going well! Mike is responding to the treatment well. However we were previously told that all visits would be covered under insurance which we now found out after receiving a bill that they weren\\'t covered as a result of this combined with the cost of airfare(having to fly up there monthly) we are in desperate need of financial assistance to pay for these mounting bills. The alternative is to discontinue treatment if we cannot come up with more $. We are grateful for those who have donated so far and we ask that you share this as much as possible flood your news feeds so we can get this trending on the GoFundMe front page. Again we are grateful for all the love and support. We are praying for a miracle and have faith that our prayers will be answered! **Update 1/28/17**It\\'s been almost a month waiting for test results and waiting to hear back from the Dr. and we finally did get some news. At first it wasn\\'t the best news as there was some deletions that caused the cancer to mutate and making it more difficult to treat. The DR.\\'s recommended that Mike try treatment of two Drugs one taken for 3 months and the other taken starting in may. The second drug because it hasn\\'t been FDA approved will have to be administered and monitored in Houston for at least 5 weeks or longer depending on how he responds to it. Depending on how he responds will determine if he will have to get either a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. We are hopeful it will not come to that. We are grateful for the continued support both spiritually and physically. The outpouring of support for mike has made this hard time much easier and we are forever grateful! I will post updates more often! Update 1/6/17 Today was the day that many of us close to Mike had been anxiously waiting for. After spending 8 hrs here at MD Anderson it was obvious that this is the place for Mike to receive treatment. All of the DRs and nurses are wonderful and very professional. The name of the Dr we met with is Dr. Gautum Borthakur.( still can\\'t pronounce it ) After meeting with him he went over Mikes condition and felt that the best treatment for him would be to use a combo of chemo/immunotherapy drugs(IFCG) to try and \"\"cure\"\" or at the very least send the chemo into remission. This news was very positive and also brought on a sense of relief. As it is possible that this treatment could really work for Mike. At this point we are now just waiting for more tests to come back before the treatment can begin. As of now it\\'s looking like he will start in a few weeks. Because this is a newer treatment he will have to receive it in Houston. Logistically we haven\\'t figured out how we pull this off as the treatment is 3-18 months. But is looking like he will have to stay in Houston or surrounding area for awhile . When we get more info I will update it. We are excited to head back home tomorrow as the temp here is a warm 30 degrees. We again want to thank each and everyone of you for your prayers and support in Mikes fight with cancer. We wouldn\\'t be able to do it with out you all! #stayinthefightmikeUpdate *2/12/17*Tomorrow Mike Will be traveling back to Houston to begin his treatment.

After spending 8 hrs here at MD Anderson it was obvious that this is the place for Mike to receive treatment. All of the DRs and nurses are wonderful and very professional. The name of the Dr we met with is Dr. Gautum Borthakur.( still can\\'t pronounce it ) After meeting with him he went over Mikes condition and felt that the best treatment for him would be to use a combo of chemo/immunotherapy drugs(IFCG) to try and \"\"cure\"\" or at the very least send the chemo into remission. This news was very positive and also brought on a sense of relief. As it is possible that this treatment could really work for Mike. At this point we are now just waiting for more tests to come back before the treatment can begin. As of now it\\'s looking like he will start in a few weeks.

       " \"Update 15 Posted by Mike Clear 1 month ago Share Hello everyone. I hope all had a great holiday season. It has been awhile since my last update so here it goes. Things have taken a turn for Mo as his transplant did not work and he is in need of our help. Whereas the donations have been awesome and still welcome Mo is now in search of an outside donor for his next stem cell transplant. Please read Sara's message below and consider signing up on the www.giftoflife.org registry to see if you are a possible match as a donor. Request a swab kit during the sign up process. The process is better described in Sara's message.Obviously this latest development means the financial burden continues for Mo and Sara so continue to spread the word of this campaign.Thank youMikeSara Schmidt is with Michael Schmidt.#StemCellsNeededHello friends and family. Just want to say thank you in advance for reading this long winded update and special request....+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Mike Clear 5 months ago Share STEM CELL TRANSPLANT COMPLETE!!!+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Mike Clear 5 months ago Share Hello folks. It's been a little while since my last update so here is the latest and it's in the category of good news:Michael got clearance to start the transplant process again so the doctor did another stem cell harvest. The doctor was hoping for 7 million stem cells for the transplant but Mo is an overachiever and produced 13 million in one day!!His bone marrow transplant actually started yesterday - 9/11!! Mo and Sara are excited about how well he did with his cell production and how strong he has been feeling. Let's keep the good vibes flowing their way with your continued support and positive thoughts.Thank you again to all who have donated to them during this time of need. It is greatly appreciated by all in the family. Mike+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Mike Clear 7 months ago Share 11 Good evening everybody. Time for another update on what's happening with Michael.I spoke to Sara this afternoon and here's the latest:The fund raising BBQ this past Saturday was a huge success. The kids had a blast for a few hours. Sara and Mo got to see so many people who conveyed their positive thoughts and vibes. This was a much needed boost since the past few weeks have been trying. They want to thank the many people who put so much time and effort into making the day the success that it was.On the medical front there have been some new developments since my last post. Unfortunately all the stem cells that were harvested for the transplant were infected and had to be discarded - postponing the transplant. Mo also developed an ear infection during this time.As I had mentioned in an earlier update Mo has had some cardiac issues with irregualr heartbeat and Tachycardia. While he was in the hospital for the infection a cardiac workup was done. Mo was cleared to go home. In the past few days his infectious disease doctor reviewed the CT scan that was done during that workup and it was discovered that Michael has an enlarged aorta that could possibly burst. The size of it is on the borderline of needing surgery.Mo is back to going to the city twice a week for chemo infusions. He had tests on his heart today as well as doctor visits to clear his ear infection. They are anxiously waiting to hear from the oncologist and cardiologist to see if Michael needs heart surgery or if it is safe and he is clear to start the transplant process all over again.Please continue your support of them during this time. It is truly appreciated. Thank you from all of us.Mike+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " \"Update 3 Posted by Sarah Pettigrew Boebel 1 month ago Share Hello family and friends of Becca Chuck and Aidan. I had hoped that I would never have to update this page again but here I am. If you’ve read Becca’s Caring Bridge page update you’ll know that her latest treatment plan is not working. Chuck and Becca were supposed to go to Duke for a follow up appointment in March but due to her latest MRI and symptoms she has started having they went Monday Jan 29th. She now has another treatment plan. Another chemotherapy drug with Avastin infusions and the introduction of an immunotherapy drug Keytruda. It’s been a long battle for her in a short amount of time that has included surgery radiation and chemo for breast cancer right into brain surgery radiation on her brain and months of different chemotherapies with Avastin infusions in between. I don’t know how a body can take all of that. From visiting with her I can see what a toll this has taken on her and her family. So my thoughts are turned to how can we help her right now. Helping her financially will relieve some stress. The Duke appointments and various of her treatments are not “in network”. She’s going to need a wheelchair and other equipment to help her on a day to day basis. If this next treatment plan doesn’t start working soon then in-home care will be around the corner. The first round of money we raised for her was fantastic but it’s been exhausted. Becca can no longer work so I’m asking you to please consider donating to her fund which will go towards this next treatment plan. These drugs and all the appointments are really expensive with minimal insurance coverage. It all adds up quickly. Right now Becca needs to focus only on Aidan Chuck and the rest of her family not how the bills will be paid. Becca has truly amazing friends and family which is a reflection of her beautiful spirit. Thank you all for your support and prayers.+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Sarah Pettigrew Boebel 10 months ago Share Rebecca has an evaluation appointment on May 18th at The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Cancer Center. This will hopefully provide some other treatment options for her. Please continue to keep her and her family in your thoughts and prayers.

Sofia did well with surgery. We would like to share an update with everyone. Thank you!:The last month had its ups and downs for Sofia. We are relieved for her to have finished her 6-month chemotherapy treatment. Her end-of-treatment scans showed the cancerous lung nodules of the relapse had been greatly reduced in size which is very important. The doctors decided to get more information however because the nodules did not disappear completely. This week Sofia went in for another surgery--this time to remove and analyze what remains of the lung nodules after all the chemo and radiation. Hopefully it is harmless scar tissue but if there is anything else to treat we need to know that also. Sofia is recovering well and now we wait to hear from her oncologist about what was found. It is hard to think about there still being cancer there after all she has gone through over the last two years but having the heartfelt support of the people that know Sofia and those that have never met her but understand the struggle she has right now is a huge help to keep us moving forward with a positive attitude.

Sofia has done so much this last month that it is hard to know where to begin.

She has pushed so hard to get through this and we are hoping for some excellent news in the next few weeks. She will have more scans this cycle which will be the first imaging in 10 weeks.

As can be expected some days are harder than others and there have been many ups and downs. I continue to be impressed and inspired by Kristy\\'s positive attitude and strength as she goes through this process. Kristy started radiation therapy on Monday January 23rd. The treatment takes place everyday Monday through Friday for a total of 19 treatments. Once she is done with radiation she can move forward with the fertility/egg retrieval process and hormone therapy.Here is a Note from Kristy that she asked me to pass along to all of you:I am so grateful for all of the generosity and well wishes sent my way! Somehow this process has been both long and quick. It\\'s definitely been a rollercoaster in all aspects. The continuing support I have received has helped me so much and I cannot thank you enough!

This means that the cancer has not spread to her lymph nodes because only one of the four nodes removed in her prior surgery contained a tumor. The doctor says that this surgery should be easier than her first since no more lymph nodes need to be removed.

       " \"Update 25 Posted by Tami-Tammy Lynn Davis-Caresio 8 months ago Share #Stalford Strong has a page with updates & its public any one is welcome to join ...+ Read MoreUpdate 24 Posted by Tami-Tammy Lynn Davis-Caresio 8 months ago Share Got Hunter out of ICU and back at BMT. Fever had been down for over 24 hrs Things are going very well got him motivated to walk a mile yesterday. His bmt doctor said they will release him from the hospital when his counts come up. His legs hurt when he stands but wanting to get out of here has pushed him through. Since all his blood cultures had no infection they think it was pre-graph syndrome and maybe irritation from the tri fusion. I guess this could be good news because the graph most likely took and it didn't kill him. Not completely sure it took yet but white blood cells are up another tenth to .4. They said it usually stair steps a couple days then has big jumps. They said if counts continue to go up he may be out early next week. Monday possibly. When his numbers come up. They will do another biopsy late make sure it's the new stuff and that's when we know for sure. Thank you all all for your continued support and prayers. Love to all.The spirit of this young man is quite amazing. Hunter had a rough night and had to have an EKG ran which came back normal. I'm not sure if its stress due to everything or just withdrawals from his pain meds. That room closes in on a person. He's having a better day than yesterday. Just took his shower. He'll walked with Travis this morning. He ate 2 bowls of cereal for breakfast and his mouth isn't hurting anymore. Praise the Lord!!! His neutrophil count is now up to 300 from 200 yesterday. They want it at 500 before he goes 'home'. So he's getting there. He walked two more times this afternoon and ate a bit more. He's trying to take small shorter walks as he builds his leg strength. They still hurt him from being in bed without movement at ICU He is also trying eating small little snacks to take in calories as Well as help with his strength. It's a long round to recovery I guess but he's working hard. Love you all and thank you for your continued prayers and support.+ Read MoreUpdate 23 Posted by Tami-Tammy Lynn Davis-Caresio 8 months ago Share Hunter is feeling a lot better today. He still can't eat real well due to the sores but the swelling has gone down a lot and he's not in pain like the last several days. Doctors were impressed with his turn around and said he made it through the worst of it and things should start looking better. Numbers are still where they should be and should begin to increase about Day 14. He's on Day 9. Thank you for your continued prayers and support. Love you all.Doctors believe it's Hunters trifusion causing fever and possible infection. They have removed it fromHis chest and are using an IV. Fever has gone down some. The team of doctors are on top of everything and he is getting excellent care. Prayers that they have found the problem and this resolves the issues. .Hunter has been experiencing a high fever that they can't get down. He also has been having low blood pressure and high heart rate. He has been moved to ICU and is currently having cat scan to check on any issues and monitor him more closely.Update: Fevers are very normal for transplant patients due to the fact that their immune system is compromised. The nurses were unable to get Hunters to come down with Tylenol and the antibiotics. His ICU specializes in transplant patients. They have taken blood cultures and changed up His antibiotics. They will take other cultures as well to check for any infections. The cat scan came back fine. They were mainly looking at his lungs and they look good.Update on Hunter from Grandma Sharon: Thought I better give 2 updates on 2 special loves in my life. First. Camden's heart cath went well but he will have open heart surgery this fall. Second. Hunter Stalford has had a pretty good day with no high fevers. He has eaten some strawberry applesauce today. He is very weak from the high fevers he had yesterday and last night. He has rested good today too. We met his BMT Dr this morning and she was very encouraging to Hunter on how BMT was going. Said everything should start getting better in the next few days when the engraftment starts taking hold and his lab counts start improving. His nurse told Ray and I that she was the smartest Dr she knew. She kept telling Hunter how young he is and that everything was going in his favor and really encouraging him not to give up. This afternoon they did an echo of his heart since he had never had one and they would have a base line. He then got a new picc line placed so he will start receiving his nutrition. The sores in his mouth will get better when his lab values improve. It is very hard as his grandparents to see all he is going through and feel so helpless! I do know that being with him and encouraging him helps to keep him strong. I also know that without the love of our God and all the prayers being said for Hunter and all his loving family we will win this battle.+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by Tami-Tammy Lynn Davis-Caresio 9 months ago Share The doctors came in and are putting Hunter on a morphine pump for the pain associated with the mouth and throat sores. They are also moving all meds but one to IV. The other they will try in a liquid form but he can try the pill if he does not like the taste. We are also monitoring his calorie intake. If he cannot get enough nutrition they will move him to nutrition through his IV. Picking yourself up and continuing on in life is sometimes difficult and we cannot also control what happens to us. We sure can control how we react. I am here to tell you all that this child is a fighter beyond anything I have ever imagined. His strength and resilience through this amazes me. It is difficult to see your child suffer but it is absolutely phenomenal to see them OVERCOME!! This is not over and he still will have rough days but any day that he gets up and moves eats and talks is a miracle in my book. Never did I dream when I held him in my arms for the first time I would witness with him what I have. If he wanted to give up I wouldn't blame him. Both my boys are so amazing and the blessings of my family and friends are a true testament that the world is good. #stalfordstrong+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 94 Posted by Alex McCrystal 1 day ago Share You guys... I\\'ve meant to post an update in a while.Olivia is doing so well. She\\'s still in speech occupational therapy and physical therapy 5 days a week and is making huge improvements. Still not speaking yet but she gets her point across just fine! And we\\'re working on it every day. One of the best things to happen in the last few weeks was that we were able to have her g-tube removed!!! Olivia is maintaining her weight and eating well so our oncologist said we could take it out. We had a consult with Olivia\\'s surgeon and because of the type of tube he was able to remove it while we were in the office. So now she no longer has a port (central line to deliver chemo) and no longer has a g-tube (feeding tube). So she\\'s more and more like a \"\"normal\"\" kid!Olivia still has significant hearing loss in one ear and there is still a lot of fluid behind her eardrum in her right ear. The fluid build up is and hearing loss is most likely because of the stretched nerves from the tumor and surgery. Because of this Olivia is having tubes put in her ears next week which will help drain the fluid and hopefully increase her ability to hear and subsequently her ability to speak.So all in all she\\'s still a super busy toddler with appointments all over the place - but she\\'s doing really REALLY well... So we can\\'t complain. I also wanted to thank everyone who reached out to me after my last posts. Being a cancer parent can be very lonely and depressing but we\\'ve been having much better days. So again no complaints. Also - a huge thank you to our parents a d friends and family and everyone who have helped us financially this past year. I\\'ve gone back to work but Ricky is still staying home with Olivia due to her crazy therapy and doctor schedules. So we REALLY appreciate you all helping to ease that financial burden. Thank you all for being here with us during this journey. We appreciate you all.With loveDanielle and Ricky and SUPER Olivia+ Read MoreUpdate 93 Posted by Alex McCrystal 23 days ago Share Olivia is doing really well at home. She\\'s currently got therapy (speech physical and occupational) five days a week. She\\'s walking fairly well making more sounds (no words yet but she\\'s trying) and learning so much every day. Because of the sheer amount of time Olivia\\'s appointments take Ricky is staying home with her while I work. We\\'re slowly adjusting to being a one income family. I\\'m trying to adjust to not being home for the day-to-day with Olivia. Ricky is adjusting to life as a toddler wrangler. And Olivia is enjoying her new world of toddlerhood.I\\'ve been trying to figure out how to put this in words for weeks. This is going to be pretty depressing. How do you explain the fear of losing a child to someone who hasn\\'t been through this? I would imagine it\\'s similar to explaining colors to a person who\\'s been blind since birth. No matter how descriptive no matter how many words... it\\'ll never quite encompass to full truth.Since the news of Olivia\\'s tumor having no blood flow one of the most common things I\\'ve heard is \"\"you must be so happy to be done\"\" and \"\"you must feel so much better.\"\" Which yes I do feel so much better so much happier more relaxed than ever.... but it\\'s not done. It\\'s not over. She\\'ll always be a \"\"cancer kid.\"\" And I\\'m still terrified. I think I\\'ve actually cried more in the last few weeks than in months prior. I don\\'t feel any different. Our good luck could change in an instant. I feel like I should be happier. I\\'ve heard \"\"Oh it must be great that she\\'s normal!\"\" And I smile and nod... but she\\'s not normal. And never will be. Of course I\\'m thrilled she is doing so well as I know not everyone gets this chance. But it\\'s still terrifying. It was almost easier for me to deal with the stress and the fear while we were going through treatment. There was something to focus on. A beast to battle. Everything was one day at a time. The end of treatment gave you a bright spot to focus on while going through hell. And now we\\'re at the end of treatment and everything should be perfect. But everything has gotten much more blurry. There is no longer a task to tackle every second. We are now just expected to go back to normal but we have no normal.I\\'m also scared to death we\\'ll become one of the families who has the unthinkable happen and when you look at recent updates you can see just how quickly things went south. I hate seeing families go from happy to devastated in a matter of weeks. I can sit and watch Olivia play and learn and be adorable and I will just break down into tears because I love her so incredibly much and can not imagine my life without her. And that fear even in a miniscule form permeates every moment of my life. So yes. We are so overjoyed. So unbelievably grateful. And hearing \"\"her tumor is dead\"\" was truly the best phone call I\\'ve ever gotten. But we\\'re not done. She\\'s not cured. We\\'re still a cancer family - and always will be. So I\\'m trying to adjust to this next phase. Because it\\'s really new. And different. And scary. Thank you for allowing me to vent about my fears. It makes it just a little bit better. And thank you for all the thoughts and love you\\'ve given to our sweet daughterthis past year...It does not go unnoticed. Danielle+ Read MoreUpdate 92 Posted by Alex McCrystal 1 month ago Share 11 Yesterday was the anniversary of Olivia\\'s diagnosis. One year ago yesterday was the worst day of our lives. The day we found out she had brain cancer the day her doctors called the code because she was unresponsive the day we were rushed the ICU the day we weren\\'t sure if Olivia was going to survive the night.Today is a new day. We found out this morning that there is no blood flow to Olivia\\'s tumor. Although that little 4mm bit is still in her brain it\\'s dead.THE. CANCER. IS. DEAD.We don\\'t know if it\\'s just dead tumor or if it\\'s scar tissue but none of that matters because there is no cancer living in her head. She\\'s really done. In four months Olivia will have another routine followup scan and until then - she is just a normal toddler. No chemo. No surgery. Nothing. Just done. Excuse me while I continue to ugly-cry over the rollercoaster of this last year and the happiness I feel for my daughter\\'s new chance at life.With more love than you\\'ll ever knowDanielle and Ricky and SUPER OliviaFrom ICU to playing in the backyard...+ Read MoreUpdate 91 Posted by Alex McCrystal 1 month ago Share The nerves are setting in. I\\'ve got so many ways to explain it - but I don\\'t know if anyone would understand unless they\\'re in my head. The best way I can think to explain it - Olivia right now is a real life Schrodingers Cat. Until we have her MRI - Olivia is both getting better and getting worse. She is both cured and terminal. She is both a normal kid and a cancer kid. Anything- good bad or otherwise- is possible. My thoughts can flip back and forth in a millisecond. One moment I\\'m watching her play and learn and quick as a flash I\\'m crying my eyes out. She\\'s both beautifully normal and extraordinarily different at the exact same time. Because of this the scan-xiety sneaks up on me. Everything is fine and dandy and BAM... What if her cancer is progressing? What if she\\'s sicker? What if she dies? And as terrible as those thoughts are all of those are possibilities just as likely as good news and tumor shrinkage. Nevertheless I\\'m sure my brain will become more and more consumed as we approach January 23rd. Please continue to keep Olivia and all of us in your thoughts.

Please don't forget he stills needs everyone's help as bills continue to come in and as he tries to get back on his feet since he can not go back to work for several months yet.

       " \"Update 2 Posted by Christina Contreras 3 months ago Share 11 Update 2: Friends and family Carmelo has had a blessed past 2 months despite some bumps in the road. Carmelo’s little baby brother Roman came into our lives earlier than anticipated in October! Roman was here just in time for our long awaited Light the Night event. Light the Night by LLS Leukemia and Lymphoma Society was a huge success for our “TEAM CARMELO” and all those who dedicated their Saturday evening at Piedmont Park to provide light to the darkness of cancer. Thank you to all our loved ones who took time out of their busy schedules to support Carmelo. Carmelo was a trooper and had a blast despite the fact he had just undergone an intense Chemo session less than 24 hours before the event. Carmelo was just one of the stars of the night that held up his “survivor” lantern proud and high up from off of daddy’s shoulders! Yes Carmelo was able to walk with a white lantern because he is officially in MAINTENANCE! Chemo sessions will continue until 2020; however our family was in awe at the scarce amount of white lanterns we saw…Carmelo is our hero and we are truly blessed. Below are some photos of TEAM CARMELO at Light the Night.Unfortunately Carmelo recently has lost mobility in his right leg and currently uses his dad’s help or crawling to get around. He is still as happy as could be even with all his toys surrounding him on the floor and various visitors that come to play with him. His parents do an incredible job of keeping him entertained no matter the circumstances. Until the next update and with lots of love Carmelo & ITEAM CARMELOBaby Roman!Light the Night- Carmelo is ready!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Christina Contreras 5 months ago Share 11 First and foremost we would like to thank each and EVERY kind soul who has donated to Carmelo’s fund. We are astonished at the overwhelming amount of love we have received and are beyond thank for each penny contributed. This journey is still in the preliminary phases and the path looks brighter thanks to all of you. We wanted to update everyone on Carmelo’s with ALL Leukemia. Carmelo has officially undergone his strongest and most rigorous chemotherapy spinal tap procedure thus and is going in routinely to continue chemotherapy treatments. Due to the intensity of this procedure Carmelo began to lose his hair and like father like son Erick shaved his head off as well with Carmelo so they could “twin-it-out”. Roxy and Erick have found such a God-given strength to shine above this adversity and fill Carmelo up with a happiness that radiates. He is all smiles and full of energy which makes all of us even more grateful. We all know he has many more rounds left in this fight but seeing him smile empowers all of us to stand proud in his corner supporting him every step of the way. A couple weeks ago Carmelo’s blood test results indicated he needed a blood transfusion which helped him tremendously. Whether it is weak legs or feeling under the weather with aches and pains Carmelo’s remembers his slogan: “What is pain?” asks his parent’s Roxy and Erick.“Pain is weakness leaving the body” responds Carmelo. ?His parents have truly gained all of our family’s admiration for the tremendous job they are doing taking care of Carmelo and catering to his every need but also preparing for the new addition to the family. It was recently announced that Carmelo will have a baby brother! Roxy is now 8 months pregnant and we all cannot wait to meet our newest addition to the Collazo troop. Yet another soldier to support Carmelo or more like yet another human being that looks up to Carmelo and admires him just like all of us. In July Carmelo had his first round of Chemo shots at home and as of August 7th day 57 of Carmelo’s delayed intensification block Carmelo surpassed doctor expectations of possibly being admitted to the hospital due the his immune deficiency and the likehood of catching any type of infection! Carmelo started his next block on August 9th but as his body recovered from his previous past session he was also able to prepare for his FIRST DAY OF PRE-K a pure blessing just this past Tuesday Sept 5th! He may have started a little late due to his chemo session this summer but he was as happy as could be to be able to go to school. Carmelo’s chemotherapy blocks will continue in order to ensure there is no relapse of Leukemia but we are thankful he is able to enjoy PRE-K. Once again we thank you all for your support. Until the next update we will leave you with just a couple more of Carmelo’s most priceless proud and sweetest moments.

       " \"Update 19 Posted by Nick Harper 5 months ago Share 11 FriendsI'm finally back from traveling and ready to fill you in on the incredible news. Yes it's true - I am officially in remission! Following treatment my scans showed no evidence of cancer at all! It was confirmed at the start of a gorgeous road trip through Colorado. It was perfect. I will attend follow ups and be closely monitored but I have NO MORE TREATMENT! I know that some symptoms will linger for weeks some for months and some for life but I'm celebrating the end of this difficult journey with all the joy in the world.To call this a long trying road would be a monumental understatement. It has tested me in every way possible. It has brought me to my knees physically emotionally and mentally. I've been at the mercy of my body in so many ways. I have lost hope gained hope feared been fearless felt numb and felt it all. Overall it has been a turbulent rollercoaster of a ride but I'm so incredibly thankful I wasn't alone.When this all began I envisioned what the future may hold for me. As most would I imagined a close circle of people rallying behind me. What happened instead was beautiful awe-inspiring and humbling. Truly the alternative was more special than I could have ever imagined. New and old friends friends with whom I'd lost touch acquaintances and even strangers gave generously in many meaningful ways.You fundraised allowing me to afford the treatment and medications I needed to survive. You celebrated alongside me during the wins and comforted me during the losses. You brought dinners sent care packages and knitted me blankets to bring along to the hospital. You helped me to grow back my eyelashes and eyebrows. You told me you couldn't see my bald spots. You didn't stare at my fake hair bruises or scars. You offered to shave your head. You sent me to acupuncture and mailed me essential oils to calm my nausea. You were understanding when I canceled plans. You wrote encouraging comments on my posts. You prayed for me. And perhaps the most meaningful of all - you kept caring. It's easy to show compassion for someone at the start but you followed along and cheered me on for two whole years. In an internet full of fashion blogs fantasy football and topical memes you took a moment for me. I feel honored by all of the times you've called me an inspiration but please know that you have inspired me every day of this fight by simply showing up to care.I'm sure I won't always be as active as I have been online over the past two years but please know that your kindness has helped to carry me to the end. It's true what they say - sometimes all you need is for someone to listen. You did that and so much more. I promise to pay it forward. Thank you doesn't even begin to express the depth of my gratitude but it's a start. Love Christina+ Read MoreUpdate 18 Posted by Nick Harper 6 months ago Share Hi FriendsI’ve had several people ask for an update and I apologize for taking so long to write one. I just finished yet another round of treatment and recently got over another infection. For the past month I have been experiencing some balance issues dizziness and persistent headaches. Because of these symptoms I had a scan to check for metastases in the brain. Though a rare location for cervical cancer metastases my oncologist thought it was necessary to rule out. I made the decision to not share this until I got the results of my MRI back (sorry family and friends). It was negative and has been ruled out. This is great news of course and I’m relieved beyond words. After the negative result my doctor explained it is likely the result of toxicity to my inner ear an effect sometimes seen with my particular chemotherapy. Luckily I am off treatment right now so this break is a perfect time to pause and consider the treatment plan progress and any needed changes. The plan is to scan the area of disease this week and hopefully have results soon as to the current level of response to treatment. As I stated recently the past rounds have reduced the area greatly and we are on the road to remission (YES). So unless something has changed these scans should show good results. I’m scared and excited to see what the timeline might be.What a long journey this has been. As time goes on and I still live in this reality I am aware of what an intentional decision I make each day to smile to find joy to be open to people and experiences outside of this and to believe. It’s not always easy but it is always worth it. Thank you all for your love and support. I managed to pass my boards and am on my way to a career helping others achieve health. I really couldn't have done it without all of you lifting me up. Thank you for fighting alongside me. I am still here still fighting and still believing. Hopefully I will be posting some good news soon :)+ Read MoreUpdate 17 Posted by Nick Harper 8 months ago Share Update from Christina:Hi FriendsWhat a whirlwind the past week has been. I finished another round of chemo and graduated nursing school two days later! It’s incredible to realize that it’s all over and I managed to finish while enduring all of this physical strain. It is a welcome feeling after such a difficult year of setbacks. I am incredibly thankful to my class faculty family and and all of you for the support. It was humbling to receive my nursing pin as my instructor whispered “You’re my hero.” My classmates stood for me. It was the most perfect end to this part of my journey and I am deeply thankful for all of the love and support I have received throughout school. Over the past months I have watched some close fellow fighters lose their battles with this disease. It is my great fortune to be alive and to move forward with my dreams and that is not lost on me.Last week I finished another round of chemo and am on a very welcome break. I have had worsening nausea over the past month and a new anti-nausea medication is helping quite a bit. My appetite is improving though I do miss food tasting the way I remember. I have been building my strength over the past few months with weight lifting and my weakness and endurance is so much better. I used to stop at every flight of stairs and managed to kayak and hike for hours this week! The fatigue and pain are still hard to control but I'm managing the best I can with acupuncture. My cancer is shrinking and I am delighted that we are not still discussing invasive surgery. The end of the road is coming - I just know it. Some days are better than others but I am managing my symptoms and staying positive.One quick plot twist- two weeks ago I self-diagnosed melanoma on my leg (yay nursing education!) I had it confirmed and removed the day before graduation. The tissue was sent to the lab and the margins came back clear. My doctor told me I had to show off and get a third cancer diagnosis before graduation. Cancer makes you a hyper-vigilant anxiety-ridden Web MD-binging crazy person. Thank goodness for that! The skin cancer is gone and I am back down to just the one cancer (haha what has life become!)For now I am enjoying a couple restful weeks off chemo studying for boards and interviewing for jobs. I am in pain nauseated itchy nosebleedy (technical term) and tired. But I am happy and thankful. The point of this whole post is that despite everything I am lucky to have this shot at life and to show people you can do what you put your mind to. Nursing school climbing mountains and next stop - beating cancer once again! <3 + Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Nick Harper 9 months ago Share Update from Christina:Hi Friends I have an update as I have been largely unresponsive to most people lately. A week ago I developed yet another infection. I was able to treat mostly at home (thanks to my stubbornness!) It was very painful but has finally resolved and I have been monitoring my temperature and symptoms since improving. My immune system hasn’t been at its best lately. If my counts dip too low I may go back on injections to boost them again. Yesterday I returned for chemotherapy. During my treatment I became uncontrollably ill. The nausea was worse than usual and I lost a lot of fluids. I had to be admitted to the hospital overnight to get my vomiting and fluid and electrolytes under control. I’m home now but I am feeling pretty miserable. When I am ill like that I often describe it as feeling as though my insides are dying. It is a deep rotting gripping pain and I am so ready to be done with all of it.The last week has really tried to kick me while I’m down. Two days ago I was struggling with managing the end of school and this crazy stressful painful expensive exhausting situation I’m constantly fighting. In the midst of that I became so overwhelmed with anxiety that I passed out. I am trying to stay positive and get through this treatment. It is a constant struggle. I am hopeful and positive but I am human and sometimes this wears on me. I hold onto the memory of what it feels like to have energy no pain and to just focus on life. I am trying to focus on graduation and the exciting things ahead. I appreciate everyone who has offered to help or checked in on me. Thank you for holding me up when I have weeks like this. All my love <3+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 24 Posted by Robin Muchnick 29 days ago Share Hi All. It\\'s been a few eventful months since the last update. As noted in the previous update Dovi\\'s last scans showed that the vast bulk of the cancer was rendered inert but there were potentially still small clusters of cells needing eradication. He was put on a long term anti-neuroblastoma medication called fenretinide. To make a long story short the fenretinide was a disaster of unanticipated adverse side effects including blindness for weeks at a time among other things.He had used the fenretinide for a few months before we had to stop it. He was off all medications for about a month and then after being hit with a severe case of the flu for several weeks this past month he began a long term regimen of alternating chemotherapy combinations of etoposide cyclophosphamide and the statin drug lovostatin which appears to have a therapeutic effect against neuroblastoma. Although the dosages are very low and adverse effects at low dosage are typically very uncommon nevertheless Dovi has been getting chemo nausea and is beginning to experience hair loss again. We\\'re hoping that his system will adapt and the side effects will abate. He had bloodwork done today to see if the chemo is affecting his blood counts or chemistry. We anticipate the next scans to be in early April. Dovi has been a tower of strength and dignity through all this. We thank everyone for your prayers thoughts wishes love and generous ongoing support. We could not have gotten this far without every one of you. With G-d\\'s help and all your prayers Dovi will beat this. We know that the celebration of thanks to G-d is on the way.+ Read MoreUpdate 23 Posted by Robin Muchnick 6 months ago Share Hi All. With tears of joy and gratitude to The Almighty I give you today\\'s update about the PET scan Dovi had today. There is a Hebrew blessing that is said when one reaches a monumental event in their lives. The words translate into \"\" Blessed is The L-rd that has kept us alive sustained us and brought us to this time. Dovi was able to say that blessing today when the doctor told us that for the first time since this ordeal began almost 5 years ago the cancer activity on the scan was close enough to zero that the scan would ordinarily be considered negative for cancer. There are still tiny areas of residual cells that show some PET activity but the doctor feels they are not multiplying and will be obliterated by continuing use of the current anti-cancer medication fenretinide for the next 1-3 years. The goal is of necessity to eliminate every last cancer cell both now and for the future and to see more negative scans that eventually reach zero activity. The use of fenretinide has it\\'s share of difficulties for Dovi. Aside from causing nausea and lethargy it also competes with vitamin A in the body and thus prevents the vitamin A from reaching the cells of the back of the eye that pick up the light coming through the lens. As a result for almost 2 weeks out of every 3 week cycle Dovi becomes partially blind and can\\'t see anything that isn\\'t extremely brightly lit up. We\\'re going to try mega-dosing on vitamin A for a few day before the cycle andagain at day 10 of the cycle to see if the rod and cone cells of the eye can store up enough vitamin A to carry him through the chemo cycle. The darkness causes a great deal of stress but it is temporary and the fenretinide is working to destroy what is left of the cancer. Dovi will continue to have scans every 4-6 cycles and down the road there will be more biopsies of any areas that continue to light up on scans just to make sure that they are only scar tissue. Treatment is continuing and we look forward to sharing more good news in the future. May all the upcoming scans in the months and years ahead remain negative! Again we thank everyone for all their prayers kindness and generosity. We would not have been able to reach this point or be able to continue on without you! May G-d bless you all with happiness and prosperity and most of all the best of health to enjoy them with! Jack and Robin Muchnick+ Read MoreUpdate 22 Posted by Robin Muchnick 8 months ago Share Hi All. It\\'s been a stressful past few weeks. In the previous update we spoke about the great improvements in Dovi\\'s illness and the long term medications fenretinide with ketoconazole that the doctor felt would be essential to help destroy the balance of the neuroblastoma cells and that Dovi would need to be on these medications for another 1-3 years or so. Two weeks ago Dovi started the new medications which needed to be taken orally. Dovi did not react well to the fenretinide. He became overcome with nausea flushed dizzy and weak. The doctor had no choice but to stop the fenretinide and let Dovi recover from this episode for a couple of weeks. The nausea from chemotherapy is usually mitigated for Dovi with the anti-nausea drug zofran. In this case zofran isn\\'t used because it doesn\\'t get along with fenretinide and can potentially cause heart abnormalities. The genetics of Dovi\\'s neuroblastoma indicate that fenretinide should be very effective in slowly eliminating the last traces of the cancer. After much examination additional cat scans and extensive heart evaluation the doctor felt that the benefits of the fenretinide were too important to just abandon it. What the doctor will do starting this Thursday is that in the hospital Dovi will get a reduced dose of fenretinide with zofran be observed for several hours and then have a cardiac exam that day. We will repeat this process on the days of additional doses making sure that his heart is safe while trying to control the severe and debilitating nausea he experienced. Dovi is continuing to show great strength and positive attitude in dealing with these new challenges. So close yet so far. We have a long way to go but we don\\'t stop moving. As we\\'ve said so often none of this would be possible without your help prayers and incredibly kind generosity. It has allowed us to continue this mission and rough-road journey of bringing Dovi safely to a full cure and recovery. With G-d on our side and with your ongoing help we will get there. May G-d bless you all.+ Read MoreUpdate 21 Posted by Robin Muchnick 9 months ago Share Hi all With tears of joy and unbounded praise to G-d we give you today\\'s update. We met with the doctor today after yesterday\\'s scans. Dovi is thank G-d on the border of heading to remission. The doctor said that we\\'re not out of the woods yet but we\\'re getting close. The activity level of the PET scans is almost normal and the bone marrow biopsies were negative. There are still scattered cells in some locations but they are dying off. The doctor is trying to arrange to put Dovi on an experimental long term drug called fenretinide. It will go after the remaining cells and cause them to mature into non-cancerous cells or die off altogether. The doctor expects Dovi to be on this medication for several years in the hopes of preventing any relapse of the disease. Dovi will have a new set of scans in 3 months. We thank G-d that the light at the end of the tunnel is no longer a freight train heading towards us. It\\'s a beacon of light created by everyone\\'s prayers to guide us through safely.The medication is not going to be covered so Dr. Maris is attempting to get it through the hospital as part of a trial for long term use.There is much to do yet but we never could have come this far without everyone\\'s help prayers and ongoing generous support. Each and every one of you has played a major role in saving Dovi\\'s life. We are forever grateful.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Erin is having to move into a smaller apartment in order to stay afloat she has medical bills that continuously are stacking up she\\'s been so sick extremely tired and hasn\\'t really left her bed in days. Last Saturday evening at our 20th class reunion several amazing classmates gathered to talk about the old days but also did a silent auction that raised money to help Erin. Erin is so beside herself with the out poor of love and generosity. It amazes me that no matter how sick she gets she tries so hard to smile and give thanks to everyone around her. It\\'s extremely inspiring. I will be starting a meal train for Erin in the next few days and I am hoping that you can help!

Since January there has been constant tears of confusion anger emptiness along with tears of happiness laughter peacefulness and gratitude. A week ago Erin did a CAT scan to see if the cancer is still there or has spread. The days leading up to this have been extremely emotionally and nerve racking for Erin and her family. Today Erin and Celeste met with the Dr about her results of her CAT scan and the news was astounding! The Dr delivered these words.... The cancer was not detected anywhere!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my god she did it she moved the mountain she fearlessly has fought and conquered. Her mom called me after hearing the news and the conversation that I had with her will be etched in my mind for the rest of my life. Rachel said oh my god Brittany my baby is going to be okay thank God! The tears today that have flown down are tears of pure happiness and relief! Erin went from finding out this incredible news to still doing her second round of chemotherapy treatment. The Dr said that she will do one treatment a month until August as long as she does well. This particular treatment can make you extremely sick so she is being cared for by Celeste tonight and we have plans for care for the days to come!

It has been a very overwhelming couple of months. Terence was put on the list for a bone marrow donor and they did not find him a match. This could be a blessing in disguise because I have not lost faith in the medicine yet. I started doing research on nutrition and foods that feed cancer and foods that heal. We have now seen a homeopathic naturopath and he confirmed that the lifestyle changes I have made in regards to T’s nutrition plan should be very helpful. This however requires me staying very close and monitoring every moment of Ter’s diet. We are currently juicing organic vegetables and fruits 4 times a day. Juicing allows the body to take in mass quantities of vitamins and minerals that kill cancer cells and provide his system a strong foundation to work with the medication.Bother sugar and Animal protein are known to feed cancer so he is now on a sugar-free plant-based diet and I am doing this with him to support and live a healthier life -trying to pave the way and lead by example.As you can imagine it is very expensive to juice. But I have to trust and believe that God will provide what we need. The hardest piece to all of this is that in order for me to be able to manage and monitor Ter’s new diet I have had to take time off of work and the financial burden of that is very scary. I have had to take a FMLA from my full-time job and now going back even part-time is proving to be very difficult between corporate policy and also the distance I have to travel to be there. Please pray that Gods will be done in terms of my job and what is best for my family. My health insurance is through this job and cancer treatment without health insurance is not something I can wrap my head around. The hope with this new diet is that his medication will start to work again and God willing he won’t need a bone marrow transplant.Please pray with me that this is the case.Thank you all for your continued support and prayers.+ Read MoreUpdate 16 Posted by Meg Glynn 5 months ago Share What we learned at CHOP yesterday:It was a lot of information and basically not even half we’re going to learn the next time we go back it’s going to be much longer and more in-depth explanation but we did learn was all very scary and of course it’s all pending the results of this last bone marrow test he had on Wednesday which we will get the results from on Monday. Basically there’s a bunch of stuff they have to do before we would even go in for a transplant -Number one being finding a donor which is not going to be an easy task because of his ethnicity and so on.At this point after year of treatment they’re concerned with him going into “blast phase” and that would be really bad and more of an emergency situation also they have not done a bone marrow transplant on a CML kid in many years because of the new medications so it’s not common anymore. It is not like any other kind of transplant where they have a surgery and open you up and take something out and put something else back in its place -it’s more like a blood transfusion that entails chemotherapy where he will lose his hair and it’s more like draining his blood killing the leukemia cells and replacing it with someone else’s blood/ platelets and then hoping that his body accepts them and begins to grow them on their own. It will require him being quarantined for several weeks after the transplant process where he cannot be around any germs of any kind as he will have no immune system and a simple cold could kill him. Also it means he will be out of school for 6 to 8 months and they want him to stay near the hospital for at least two months so it would mean he and I would have to be in some kind of temporary housing for a couple months in Philly like the Ronald McDonald house. And as if all of that wasn’t enough it is not a 100% guaranteed procedure because the CML could still come back it can be two days later or 10 years later. And of course the most terrifying part of it is that she (The Dr.) said most people survive the transplant but there are several complications that can occur. Her number one concern is infection and something else that is a disease that has to do with his body potentially rejecting the donors some kind of platelets or something in which case he could break out in a rash all over his body and then they would have to treat that. That is the short of the long and apparently only a fraction of the information. If he hasn’t had some dramatic drop in his numbers that shows up in this last test he is at serious risk and the “blast phase” could start anytime or not not for a year but apparently it is a much more critical and emergency and unplanned scenario if he is already in blast. So it is a gamble either way weather we go ahead and get the transplant process under weigh or if we decide to wait and “see what happens” .We need a miracle. Please help us pray for one.+ Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by Meg Glynn 5 months ago Share Also- I just wanted to share this incredible side-by-side these two pictures are from Terence's first day of school last year and his first day of school this year.

       " '\"Update 3 Posted by Sahr A. Brima 3 months ago Share Hello friends.Thanks again for your continued prayers and support! I wanted to share another joyful update with you all. The latest results from my MRI show the tumor has shrunk again this time to less than 10% of the original size (which was one inch in diameter or so). The doctor said he could tell me exactly the amount remaining but he would have to take out my brain to tell me for sure and he said he really want\\'s me to keep my brain! It was a well timed joke and he was as pleased to give us the news as we were to hear it! While trusting that God\\'s plan has been the best plan from the beginning it is exciting and astounding to see that His plan has been to heal my brain. We are all very hopeful that this is the case and continue to be blown away by God\\'s grace (in particular you all) even in the dark valleys. It could be a long journey ahead but we are confident His grace will meet us there and are comforted.P.S. - A shrinking tumor leads to shrinking symptoms which has been especially wonderful. While my double vision still remains it seems like such a minor inconvenience compared to where things were are just a few short months ago. Prayers for continued improvement would be much appreciated and for complete healing of the tumor.Much loveJen+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Sahr A. Brima 4 months ago Share Some Really Good NewsIt has been a while since we last shared an update! The leaves have almost all fallen off our trees the kids are settling into their new rhythms of school and we are starting to find our new “normal” as a family. Jen is thankful she no longer has to go to radiation treatments every day and savors the time she spends at home with the children. Jen has been receiving chemo infusions every other week and taking the pill form as well. She has been tolerating the medications very well. And now for the good news! Last week we went in for an MRI scan and doctor appointment. The MRI’s can cause a lot of anxiety for Jen for many reasons. One of which being that this specific tumor is usually very resistant to any type of treatment. The doctor would have been thrilled if the tumor would have stayed the same size and not grown at all. But God gave us a mighty miracle and shrunk Jen’s tumor by 1/3!! Only He could have done such an incredible work; all glory be to Him! We are still in awe of God’s mercy and kindness toward us and in His healing power. Would you pray He would continue to work a miracle and completely shrink Jen’s tumor even by Christmas? He is able! May it be so Lord.Jen has been encouraged by Psalm 71:18 “So even to old age and gray hairs O God do not forsake me until I proclaim your might to another generation your power to all those to come.\"\"+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Sahr A. Brima 5 months ago Share New message from Jen:Hello friends.It has been a challenging and exhausting couple of months but I\\'m grateful for so many things including all of your love and support! With the location of the tumor and the aggressive nature it was important to start radiation immediately after my biopsy brain surgery. Being done with radiation is bitter-sweet. Sweet in that there are more days without a doctor appointment and my brain can begin healing difficult in that I can only get radiation once and it\\'s one of the best tools available to keep the tumor at bay. It\\'s still early be we remain hopeful that the radiation is working. Early indications are positive and I\\'m trying a new drug administered through infusions that may also help control the tumor. My latest surgery was the implanting of a speed port for future IV infusions and medication. Knowing it could be a long and difficult ride I\\'m hoping this little device is a friend:)The kids are wonderful and I\\'m so glad to be their mom. It can be heartbreaking to watch them in pain and to help them through their anxiety but I have a great friend and partner in my husband Josh who helps me navigate difficult waters when they arise. There are very difficult days and likely many more ahead but we are placing our hope in Jesus and trying to take it one day at a time. We are hopeful my vision will return to a point where I can do more and more \"\"normal\"\" things with my family and friends. While not the story I would have written God is still kind and his purposes are always good for those who trust him.So very thankful for all of you. With love Jen+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

I am continuing my Gofundme page in the hopes of raising a total of $6000. That means I only need another $1300 in the next 40 days so I can give the remainder of the proceeds in another donation. I found out that each patient who is entered into the ITOMIC trial that I am currently in costs $125000. Last year the Fundraiser raised $125000.

       " \"Update 35 Posted by Laci Caraway 16 months ago Share Oh what a difference a year can make. One year ago today at 2:30 in the afternoon my doctor called and confirmed my suspicions. I had just put my students on the bus and then found out that I had breast cancer. I remember walking into my good friend’s classroom to tell her. She had been with me from the beginning when I found my lump. We had seriously thought it was no big deal but thought that I should get it checked out just in case. Well thank goodness I did. She cried and I had a nervous laugh. I had a feeling this was going to be the outcome so I wasn’t shocked or surprised. I remember feeling like “ok well what happens now?” Then I had to go to my son’s school for a parent teacher conference haha. Life goes on.Looking back now I can’t believe the journey that I have been on. It wasn’t easy but I tried to stay positive through it all and not complain. This was a trial in my life and I wanted to fight it gracefully. And fight I did. This was not going to be the end of me at 31 years old. I had a 19 month old baby and two older children that still needed their mother. I was determined that this was only going to be a bump in my long road.Through my dark and depressing days I remember praying more than I ever have in my life. God was with me carrying me when I couldn’t walk alone. And his servants were everywhere! I lost count in all of the wonderful people who stepped up and helped me and my family. The countless meals that were brought to my house after each chemo childcare uplifting phone calls sweet cards in the mail from women I had never even met! Little gifts of inspiration to bright my spirits and give me hope large baskets of goodies to fill the long hours of chemo and many many prayers that were said on my behave. A random women at my very first chemo gave me a 31 tote bag filled with random things that I might need during my chemo. She had four tote bags with her and gave them away whenever she met a new member of the club. I remember crying in the elevator on my way home. What a sweet gift from a complete stranger. The many many people who helped my family last Christmas was amazing and humbling. My children were “adopted” by strangers who bought them gifts. People from my husband’s work bought us gifts as well. We received tickets for the whole family to go to the Monster Truck Show. Gabriel was in heaven! Another wonderful person (probably a busy mom) gave me two free house cleaning services. Oh what a blessing that was when I was so tired from chemo. Someone else bought us two meals from Blue Apron which is a company that delivers the food to your door with everything needed including directions to cook a nice meal. This was really cool! A wonderful woman and fellow breast cancer survivor mailed me a cd with uplifting inspirational music to lift my mood during dark days. This woman has also become a dear friend. She lives in a completely different state and I finally got to meet her last July! I am also extremely grateful for the many friends family and strangers that have given money to help my family get through these hard times. Jacob’s work also put on a cancer fundraiser to help raise money for our family and another woman battling cancer at Jacob’s department. I am in awe of the blessings and friendships that have come from this experience. A few weeks ago my local hospital had a breast cancer awareness fundraiser dinner. Each year they choose 10 breast cancer survivors (men and women) to model in the fashion show during the event. I was chosen as one of the models this year. I got to meet a lady at Belk who helped me pick out an outfit shoes and accessories FREE. Then I wore this outfit during the fashion show. Afterwards we were allowed to keep the clothes that were purchased for us. What another amazing blessing and really cool experience. One I will never forget. They even had a modeling coach there to teach us a routine when we walked down the runway. My turns were on point! As I reflect on this past year I have kept a binder of everything that I have gone through. All the papers the lab work the surgical notes and the bills. This is what I have gone through so far.I have had 100 appointments.4 Mammograms6 Chemos31 Radiations5 Echo cardiograms (with one more scheduled next week)11 Herceptins (and my last one is next week)3 Surgeries (with another scheduled in December)And a PET scan CT scan and Bone Density scan.This past year was the hardest year of my life. I have had more challenges thrown my way than I could have imagined. But through it all (and with LOTS of HELP) I have made it. My last mammogram was last week and everything looks great! I am almost at the end of this journey. I thank you all however you might have contributed (even happy thoughts and prayers) and thank God that I’m still here today.All Dolled UpMe and Jacob+ Read MoreUpdate 34 Posted by Laci Caraway 17 months ago Share So last Friday was my big appointment. I couldn’t eat or drink anything until after my CT scans. I got to the hospital at 9:30am. When they called me back I was asked what kind of drink I liked. They mixed the contrast drink with Sprite and I had to drink two cans worth within fifteen minutes. The contrast had no taste so all I tasted was the Sprite. Then I had to wait 45 minutes for the fluids to work their way through my bowels. While I was waiting the bone scan people came and gave me the radioactive shot for my bone density scan. I had to wait three hours before I could have that scan done. So I did what any normal teacher would do. I pulled out some papers and started grading them. All while sipping on my Sprite concoction. When the waiting period was over I was asked to drink a little bit more Sprite mix to top of my stomach. Then I had the CT scan. I had to lie still while the big machine took pictures from my neck down to my thighs. I just closed my eyes and dosed off until it was over. About half an hour later I was done and it was time for lunch. Jacob met me across the street from the hospital and we had lunch together. That was a nice little break in my day. After lunch I had about an hour to kill until my bone scan. I found a quiet place in the hospital and did school work on my laptop. I knew I was going to be here all day so I came prepared with things to work on.Around 1:30 I went back to the radiology department. They took me back to a different machine. I laid down and the guy hooked me up to an IV. These scans were much quicker. I did one set of scans then the guy gave me an injection in my IV. It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy and kind of gives you hot flashes. Then they did another set of scans and I was done. I was told I would get the results the following week. So then I went and picked up the kids from school and continued on with my normal routine. On Thursday I had my normal Herceptin appointment. I only have TWO more left! I brought a bucket of work to do my headphones and I rocked out while working. I was in a great mood. I’m sure the other sickly people were wondering what my deal was and why I was so happy but I didn’t care. I think people need to see other cancer patients happy and enjoying life. I want to give them hope that things can get better after chemo. After my Herceptin appointment I had a checkup appointment with my oncologist. He told me that my scans all came back clean! My scans checked my: chest lungs heart aorta soft tissues bones abdomen liver gallbladder pancreas adrenal glands kidneys spleen gastrointestinal vascular structures and pelvis. My bone scan said “There is normal marrow activity with no abnormal foci of radiotracer activity to suggest osseous abnormality.” So all is good!The doctor also told me that my last echocardiogram showed that my heart is still healthy and not showing damage from the Herceptin. This is all wonderful news. I have two more Herceptin appointments a mammogram is scheduled for October and then in November I should get my port removed! I am so excited that this long journey is almost over. Thank you all again for your continued love support and prayers. My sister Miranda and ICohen+ Read MoreUpdate 33 Posted by Laci Caraway 18 months ago Share Hello family friends and strangers. I hope you all have had a wonderful summer! I think this has been the best summer ever! My main goal was to spend as much time with my family as possible. We were able to go to the beach twice this year! We went with both sides of the family and got to spend some much needed time with parents grandparents aunts uncles brothers sisters and cousins.I am still carrying on with my journey. The hard part is over but I’m not going to be “done” for a long time. I still go every three weeks and get Herceptin in my port. I had another echo cardiogram last month. The results showed that my heart has been affected slightly but not enough to stop the Herceptin. They will do another echo in four to six weeks to continue monitoring my heart. School has started back and I have been as busy as ever! I am very excited for this school year. I have a great group of kids and I’m excited for all the learning and growing that we will do this year (myself included). In a few weeks I have a big appointment coming up. I will have a CT scan and a bone marrow scan. I had a PET scan done last October but I’ve never had a CT or bone scan. These are both new to me. I continue to have faith that all will be well and put everything in the Lord’s hands so hopefully these scans will go smoothly and they won’t find anything. The last appointment that I have scheduled as of right now is another mammogram in October. So although the chemo and radiation are over there are still many appointments and tests to be done. However I am forever grateful for modern medicine and know that my Heavenly Father is watching over me and my family. We are so blessed and loved.Beach July 2016+ Read MoreUpdate 32 Posted by Laci Caraway 20 months ago Share Laci's Rally Against Breast Cancer has reached 53% of its goal.

We are heart broken to say Mahlon's battle has come to an end he fought hard to the very last breath. Mahlon has now been reunited with his mom in Heaven #TeamMahlonJohn 14:1-4 “Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms.

Monday Mahlon will get his bone marrow checked out for more definite results. The doctors are being optimistic and believe Mahlon can beat this bump in the road to FULL recovery. Thank you to everyone who have been praying for him the past couple of days & through everything.?? Please continue to pray for Mahlon's miracle!+ Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Leah Lawler 28 months ago Share 22 On Thursday October 29th Mahlon had his 4th lumbar puncture which went well but the nasal scope showed he had an area of dead tissue in his sinus cavity from a fungal infection that must be removed to prevent more fungal growth. Fungus is a big concern for leukemia patients as the body does not have infection fighting material. Antibiotics help with bacteria but fungal infections are a bit harder. Therefore Mahlon underwent surgery on Friday to have an area of nasal cavity that had dead cells (black tissue instead of pink) removed. Surgery went good but Mahlon has had to endure lots of bleeding since. To brighten his mood he got a visit from his little cousin Lorelei and then on Halloween Darth Vader stopped by!Mahlon & his cousin LoreleiDarth Vader & Mahlon+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Leah Lawler 28 months ago Share 22 After a rough start to Mahlon's morning with chills and an upset stomach doctors changed meds and by 10:30 he was feeling better.

We cannot express how grateful we are for all of the love and support that poured in from family and friends. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts thank you and we love you all!We are happy to announce that Michelle recently completed her 6th and final round of full chemotherapy. We recognized from the beginning of her diagnosis that the chemo stage would be the most trying. The next steps are: (1) surgery; (2) radiation; (3) preventative hormone treatment. However seeing how strong Michelle was throughout the chemo stage I am sure things will only continue to get easier. The sense of community we have felt around us has been amazing. We thank each and everyone one of you who reached out to us. It helps so much to know that we were not going through all of this alone. We will continue to update everyone as things only continue to get better. Michelle's mother Sylvia has been visiting and helping care for Michelle during each cycle of chemo. During each cycle we would take a picture of Michelle and this is a picture of Michelle during her 6th and final chemo cycle. For obvious reasons she was the happiest and most anxious in this photo.

       " \"Update 37 Posted by Pam Solie 4 months ago Share Today October 27 2017Two years ago we learned of the leukemia cancer that would so disrupt our world. WAIT - Disrupt? (Did I just say that?!) Maybe more like “Blenderize”! I do not need to go down this road let’s not forget that all of you have been living this with us. No surprise that I would say this again WHO KNEW? I do not want the tone of this post to take the wrong tack….. Aside from the challenges that continue we have so much to be thankful for and celebrate. Simply this post is to Cheer! Two years and one bone marrow transplant later we have a cancer free Patti. Alleluia ! So here is where we are. Patti’s bone marrow is fully functional; her lab numbers continue to show stability. No concerns. She is in very good shape. She continues to push herself daily to gain more strength. Daily walks and activity is increasing. Patti talks frequently about new foods that she sees or craves. Pasta is almost an obsession right now. Still small servings but now these servings are adding to the daily calorie needs. Several weeks back the feeding tube was “refreshed” (new one put in after 8 months - standard protocol.) The tube’s use is waning as Patti continues to be able to introduce oral foods and liquids to meet her daily needs. Patti has met her goal of arriving at a healthy body weight. Having folks over for coffee is a joy again as well as planning “Sunday Supper” gatherings! So great! What is still being addressed is: The neuropathy in her hands and feet. This very slow and uncertain return to normal here challenges continuously. It is very difficult to manipulate her fingers making fine motor activity a barrier. Similar with her feet balance is a concern walking is restricted. Hope is that continued activity will allow for the nerve cells to rebuild and return to full capacity. No one is able to clearly put an accurate timeline on this - just have to wait and see how much recovery will occur. Her eyes are dry and the eyelids (mostly the left eye) are turned inward and cause discomfort. Patti now wears a daily contact bandage lens that eliminates the irritating lash scraping on her eyeball. GI function is improving. Swallowing and aspiration are improving but she has to be very careful to completely chew food and slowly swallow foods. Although still present far less choking and coughing during meals. Overall this lady is on her way back! The changes in her have been nothing short of miraculous for the past few months. She is so much more the Patti that we remember and the Patti that she wants to be! Very active and conversational really looking forward to what is next. If you are so inclined reach out to her - she would love to hear from you. And as said many time before; as we commit to the daily needs of the journey we look for and find joy in every day. Thank you for being so much a part of Patti’s recovery we could not do this without you! God bless you all! -John(Photos below are from a recent wedding Patti & John attended. Beautiful photos of Patti & John another with their friends at the wedding and Patti loved the cheese table at the reception).+ Read MoreUpdate 36 Posted by Pam Solie 8 months ago Share WOW!!!

Please be sure to clear your schedules and join us for a great evening of personal and financial encouragement for their family. It has been a long road and every penny is needed. A flier with details about the Benefit is included at the end of this post. And now the update on Patti!!. . . Thursday June 15 2017 --- Day 450. . .Greetings to everyone who is following Patti and her journey. This post may be confusing at first but will be clear by the end.[Friday June 24 2016 - Day 77] - Imagine learning you have a life threatening illness. Imagine being told that there is a cure for the illness but the process will be difficult. Imagine also hearing that when all the horrible unimaginable obstacles are addressed and overcome you still have a 50% chance that the illness would be present. Now imagine hearing that tests conducted to detect the presence of the illness show that the illness is NOT present.Now stop using your imagination and listen to the news we just learned that Patti’s new bone marrow is free from Leukemia!! Late yesterday afternoon we got the phone call from our lead Doctor sharing that the biopsy Patti had on Tuesday indicates that the transplant has eradicated the cancer. What this really means for Patti is that we will continue to focus on regaining strength and push for the things that will support her recovery. As good as this new is there is still a great deal of work for Patti to do and there are still issues to face. Many many thank-you’s to everyone for your amazing support and willingness to come along on this long journey. Prayers are being answered miracles have occurred! We now will celebrate this joy set it aside and return to “Patti - you got this girl”!As we learned the good news of Patti’s June 6 2017 Bone Marrow biopsy results I searched for words to share as an update. I found this post from almost a full year ago. The only item x’d out and replaced is the date. Every other word thought and reality remains exactly the same! [June 24 2016] Changed to today Thursday June 15 2017 Day 450. Re-read the post and pay close attention to the final line. ‘We look for and find joy in every day but set it aside and return to the journey.’ Thank you for being so much a part of Patti’s recovery we could not do this without you! God bless you all! Johnp.s. Last month John & Patti's son Mitchell graduated from Hamline University. Patti was feeling well enough to attend and help celebrate this great accomplishment!

       " \"Update 2 Posted by Anastasia Wolfe 23 months ago Share Hey Everyone I just wanted to provide an update on how Zach is doing with his treatments.As of today Zach has had 4 rounds of chemo. Unfortunately he has fallen behind on his chemotherapy schedule and has another 8 rounds to go. His body is having a hard time bouncing back after the treatments with his white blood cells consistently being too low to receive treatment. This in turn has made it to where he has had to receive shots to boost his white blood cells to an appropriate level for him to receive the chemo. Although we are grateful that the shots are helping him to receive the chemo they cause a lot of added pain for Zach and we just hope the shots can eventually be stopped. On a positive note Zach is finally being able to get his port with the procedure scheduled for this monday April 4th. He has been receiving chemo through a peripheral IV thus far due to the lump in his neck making him ineligible for the procedure. Thankfully the lump in his neck has seemed to reduce in size making it to where he can now have the procedure for a port. He will then start receiving his chemo and fluid treatments through the port which reduces some of the risks associated with receiving chemo through a peripheral site. (and will hopefully make him feel a little less like a pin cushion). We can not thank everyone enough for all of the support and encouragement we have received thus far and could not make it through this rough patch without everyone's prayers. As he continues his treatment we just ask that everyone keep us in their thoughts as we continue this difficult journey and pray that Zach's body handle the treatments a little better with the months to come. + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Anastasia Wolfe 26 months ago Share Hi everyone I just wanted to express our families gratitude for everyone's support.

Words can not begin to explain just how blessed I am. Just a few months ago I was diagnosed with one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer. At that point I could not imagine getting to this point. I was afraid like I have never feared anything in my life. I keep thinking over and over again Briana you know how this ends you know how it plays out in the end. You've been a how many bedsides watching this end watching helplessly. I felt helpless. I feared if my son would remember me or if my daughter would know me at all. I know they have a great dad but I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to watch them grow up and give them the mom they deserve. But my God is bigger than any disease or fear. My God said that he would never leave me nor forsake me. No one can ever tell me he is not real. The same doctor that told me how dangerous and aggressive this cancer is the same one who told me on Monday there is no trace of cancer in my body right now. Only God could do that. Those nights I sat up and cried to myself watching my son and husband sleep those countless days I made myself get up and move around so I wouldn't have to see juju cry or hear him say he wants me to feel better again. Those days and nights will continue to haunt my dreams. Playing on repeat my 2 year olds voice telling my mom it's not fair I want my mommy to feel better I want the doctor to fix her. Those days i cried until my eyes hurt. The millions of times I prayed for God to give me strength so my family and friends would believe me when I told them I felt fine but felt horrible. This are the things I will remember each time I see these scars oon my body. Most of all I will remember all the love and support I got from my family and friends! I love all of you.

       " \"Update 2 Posted by Shawn Page 37 months ago Share Shawn was scheduled to be admitted today for another round of chemo. Instead he will have to do a 10-day stronger antibiotic first. His Philadelphia chromosome is still showing (has decreased slowly) so she's going to change his IV chemo. He'll start that a week from Monday. After discussion they'll let him do it outpatient - every day for 5 days. Will need an EKG after it and can't take his oral chemo with it. Possibly picking a donor tomorrow and transplant could still be the end of March.+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Shawn Page 40 months ago Share Shawn is looking at a very long recovery & treatment time.

       " 'Update 1 Posted by Gabrielle LoParo 35 months ago Share We have not updated this as of late as it has been a struggle for Joe and the whole family. He has had 4 R-EPOCH chemo treatments with the first 2 showing significant progress in reducing the large tumor compressing his kidneys and the nerves for his right leg. His left kidney is now functioning and supporting his bodies needs presently. His right kidney is still not functional and he still has neuropathy and pain in the right leg. The next 2 treatments raised concern. His large tumor had no significant shrinkage and 2 other small tumors had popped up/ The new nes were cause for most concern. We were referred to the City of Hope Cancer Center ( www.cityofhope.org ). Here we met with and are now under there care also for an upcoming stem cell transplant. Until a donor is found and the process happens he has had 2 additional rounds of RICE Chemo therapy. Along with many blood and platelet transfusions. He still has a long road to recovery ahead of him and we thank all of you from the bottom of our hearts for your assistance support and prayers.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

Thank you all for the prayers and support and please continue to share Eli's page and supporting this family if you can!

The doctors say that Eli is doing well and should have a good prognosis. To decrease the risk for bleeding they have given him platelets for the fourth time today. His heart and labs are being monitored closely each day and have been ok or simple to correct. Eli takes his medicine like a champion and is still being his silly self. This is a verse Shani and Russ have been holding close through this time and wanted us to share: “For I know the plans I have for you” declares the Lord “plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me and I will listen to you.”Jeremiah 29:11-12 NIV Thank you all so much for your prayers thoughts and support thus far! You have all blessed our family.

He received more potassium this morning and played with his friend Henry reading books and riding on cars. After getting his daily EKG Eli felt sleepy and fell asleep to some kids songs on YouTube. While waiting for the arsenic for the day Shani relaxed on the day bed and Russ took baby Shepard shopping for some snacks and other necessities. It has been a good morning. :) We've received such a large number of donations in such a short amount of time and the family is feeling so incredibly blessed.

       " \"Update 15 Posted by Lee E. Gross 10 months ago Share 11 It has been a good while since I have written an update. Since last time Landon has managed to finish his chemo but his last round was a heavy hitter. Where I thought I would be back to work full time by now I'm finding myself in the hospital on any day I don't work. His stats are not great and his oxygen levels are low even on oxygen. His hair has also begun to fall out and his body is trying to fight of a viral and bacterial infection with a crap immune system. They are doing all they can to keep him stable and the hope is that we can get him stable and get him home safely. Thank you all so much for your blessings and prayers. Please keep them coming.+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by Lee E. Gross 14 months ago Share So it has been a while since I got the chance to post an update so here goes. Landon has done very well with the chemotherapy this time but it appears that the neuro side of things looks to be our challenge this time. Since his brain surgery Landon has been experiencing the typical ataxia. Meaning one side of his body is not working the same way the other is. His left side has struggled and the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) has leaked and built up off and on since the word go. Due to this buildup Landon is going to need a permanent shunt to be placed to help drain the fluid from his head into his abdomen. So we got to go home 3 days ago under the impression that we would be going home for the weekend till next week. I am sad to report that after our follow up today that it looks like our timeline has been moved up. We will be checked in as inpatient tonight to get scans and prepare for surgery tomorrow. Our whole family is very saddened by this news knowing that what little time we do get at home is being taken from us. Prayers for a successful surgery and a speedy recovery. Our next round of chemotherapy is coming fast.+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by Lee E. Gross 14 months ago Share So the holidays are over and with that comes us re-entering the hospital for landons's next round of chemo. This comes with some news that I had not wanted to hear. The neuro team has let us know that Landon is still leaking CSF from his suture line. This is a serious issue as CSF counters the healing process. So it looks like after much discussion we will be forced to place a permanent shunt in Landons body to help him drain the CSF. As a team we decided it best to wait till after this round of chemo so we will be here for another long run. Probably 5 weeks at the very minimum. Tomorrow they will place extra stitches to try and stop the leaking in hopes that it can allow him time to avoid further issues like infections until his counts come up and we can place the shunt. Hopefully all of this will go well and we will make it through yet another wall that this poor child has had to charge through.+ Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Lee E. Gross 14 months ago Share So the dark side of chemo has begun. Landons counts (white blood cells ANC platelets IGG) levels have all began to bottom out. He is in good spirits but his face shows otherwise. He is the toughest kid I know and I hope you all continue to pray. He spiked a decent fever today so it's high alert time till we get whatever is causing it under control. Looking also like Landon will not be home for Christmas...I was really holding onto that hope. Please continue to share our story keep the prayers going and thank you all in advance for any help you can provide for us at this time.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 26 Posted by Jim Hough 4 months ago Share 11 I sit here tonight humbled.I have a home filled with children laughing and playing with kids looking to tomorrow with hope and expectations.Some of our friend over the last year too many sit in home that are too quiet that are silenced by a disease that has ripped their families from their foundations and made them face a reality that no one should have to. Voices united by a thousand injections and a million tears and a billion unanswered prayers and pleads to a faceless hope that has remained unfortunately silent.I came home tonight to my wife smiling and dancing and hopeful I came home to a wife that has watched children she loved die and parents she respected break and dreams she has held onto fall away from her hands like sand from the ocean. And yet....she was happy truly happy and hopeful. And that is a rare thing anymore.There is a song by the band Imagine Dragons called \"\"Thunder\"\" and if you listen to the lyrics really listen it is the perfect song for all of us who have been touched by childhood cancer.Amanda hugged my tonight and cried in my arms that she wanted something WANTED something since our child got diagnosed she hasn\\'t wanted anything for herself. She has dedicated every waking moment to our children and family. Tonight she wanted something for every other family that has experienced what we have.She has a vision with pictures and sound that can hopefully help out other families and sick kids.She wants to make a music video.Yep I know it sounds crazy but if you looked at her eyes and saw her heart pouring out of them you would see what I can see. She has a vision of pictures and words across a screen while this song plays.I try not to ask a lot of this crappy scenario we have been dealt. My pride is strong and is a personality fault of mine. You all have helped out family so much in the last 18 months. This isn\\'t for us though this is for every family whose kid gets diagnosed with this monster. For every family who receives the news that their child is no longer just a \"\"kid\"\" that they are a statistic and a number in a game of odds that no one should be playing.If any of you have any kind of pull with Russel Wilson and the Seahawks PR with Seattle Cancer Care Alliance or has photos of their little ones battling cancer (I know a bunch of you have those). Please reach out to us. We have an incredibly talented professional photographer who has dedicated her time and money to showing what this fight is all about. She wants to help and so do we.Please help us with this please help us to make something that we can look at our kids and friends and nurses and say \"\"look what we did\"\".We need photos and exposure on this we need the blessing of Imagine Dragons to use their song we have an idea a spark of something that could become beautiful and impact people on this crazy journey.If you know how to reach out to any of these people or just a thread that we can run down please help us.We love you all every single one of you has been an instrumental person in the fight for Jocelin and her life.Thank you all so much.Please contact us with ideas on how to make this happen at:jhough@7cedarsresort.com360.477.0288Y\\'all rock-Jim and the Girls HoughP.S.

In reality though I am just a sleep deprived dad standing on a piano wire between joy and depression.I apologize about the extended absence. Many of you who donated are friends of ours on Facebook and so have seen us there but many of you are not. I have been meaning to update everyone for a long long time but its really hard.It\\'s hard to log back into this. It\\'s hard to see my earlier updates when we were spiraling downwards it\\'s hard to see how much we ended up having to depend on people to get is through things it\\'s hard to see that amount of money raised and think \"\"wow that went quick\"\" it\\'s hard to think that there are people out there that raised 2 thousand dollars or 2 hundred or nothing. It\\'s hard to keep my pride and ego quiet and accept how lucky we were. It\\'s hard being scared all the time scared of a cough scared of your neighbors scared of relapse scared of your lack of strength scared of your parenting...scared of being scared forever.It\\'s hard to live with the guilt that comes from your kid being alive some of her friends being dead and your complete lack of power to effect either of those outcomes.It\\'s all really really really fucking hard.That said Jocelin is doing absolutely and unequivocally amazing.She has been in school she has gotten colds we have had chickenpox scares. We have played in parks celebrated birthdays laughed and cried together. She has been grounded lost teeth learned to use scissors and accidentally drank some of my wine one night.We sold our house in Walla Walla (selling your childhood home is super sad by the way). We moved into a new house here in Sequim and we realized how deep Amandas\\' obsession with holiday decorations runs. *hint* *hint* it runs deep like the grand canyon...my god.We went home for Christmas and saw many of you not all of you unfortunatelyand boy was that trip like a drink of water for a thirsty soul. It was weird seeing our old home with someone elses car in front of it but that was overshadowed by the love and friendship we received from people we hadn\\'t seen in over a year.Jocelins hair is starting to grow back and her weight is stabilizing she hasn\\'t had a feeding tube in about 2 months. She still takes daily Chemo for about the next 2 years and we still have to make trips over to Seattle pretty often for in patient chemo and lumbar punctures. In fact we are heading over on the 8th to stay the night because we have a super early morning appointment on the 9th. All of her lab results have been great her body is producing the cells it should and she is still in remission. As Jocelin would say \"\"I\\'m kicking cancers butt\"\"All in all she is a pretty normal little 5 year old. Just pale and with a pixie cut. Actually as I type that I realize that isn\\'t accurate. She is not normal at all she has been through hell and back and is pretty damn amazing. I sell her short when I say that she is anything less.As for the rest of us...Lily is doing great in 3rd grade she still has some anxiety issues but they are starting to fade which is great. Kahlan is a very spunky 4 year old but her social skills are about the same level as an over-ripe banana. This girl needs to get into school quick to meet friends.I won\\'t speak for Amanda but I assume she feels the same as I do. I feel like 2 people happy and fun and gregarious and scared and hesitant and nervous. People always tell us that we are so strong but I don\\'t feel strong. I feel weak I feel stretched thin like a rubber band shaking right before it breaks. The only reason I can imagine that I haven\\'t broken yet is that I am entirely too stubborn to be forced into something.If you made it all the way through this. Thanks for reading. If you didn\\'t it was just me whining a bunch anyways don\\'t worry you didn\\'t miss much :)Thank you all for being part of the disaster that was 2016. You all helped hold the mountain back from falling down on our heads. That is more then I could ever ask of any one person let alone the hundreds of you that donated to us. If you believe in 1 God many or none at all please continue to send prayers and words of encouragement for us in the coming year. Also donate to the Ronald McDonald house when you go and buy a cheese burger. it\\'s a really good cause.If any of you happen to win the lottery and are looking for a good place to throw a few bucks we are still accepting donations here. We still have medical bills and travel costs and debt incurred from the last 11 months etc....you wouldn\\'t believe how expensive a year of cancer treatment is. Well statistically some of you probably do know and i\\'m sorry you do.I will attach a few recent photos.Thank you all again so much.With love the Rough Tough HoughsThe girls with their uncle this xmasJocelin repping the hawks!

Thanks Brendan and Lacey that was amazingly generous of you.We have all been slipping into the school routine. jocelin is LOVING school and is over the moon about riding the bus. Her hair is starting to come in and is about a quarter inch long at this point. She looks hilarious. She is also losing a little bit of weight because the medication she is still on is messing with her appetite. We are trying to get her as many calories as possible so we can keep her off the feeding tube for good but Jocelin is headstrong and stubborn as hell so we will see how that goes.Treatment wise she has 2 appointments left before we hit maintenance phase....which is almost the end!!!!! well its still 2 years of treatment but only 1 a month appointments and a daily pill. And we can travel farther then an hour from the hospital and she is basically not restricted from anything!Its hard to get excited about this all though the worry of her getting sick again is always present in our minds. I feel like I should be more guarded and not as happy as I feel sometimes I feel guilty as hell everytime we see people we know losing kids....There is alot of happiness and alot of guilt and sadness involved in having a kid with cancer.We are in the planning stages for Jocelins Make A Wish trip to Disneyland in the spring. We are very excited about this opportunity and when we get more info about things we will post to let everyone know! I know there is some kind of a big party to reveal the wish to Jocelin a few weeks before we actually leave and I would love to invite everyone who has donated to us to it if only to see and meet the little girl you have all helped.Time to go make dinner in our own home and eat a family meal with a bald little ball of energy.

       " \"Update 4 Posted by Mandy Anderson 23 months ago Share 11 The enthusiasm of the last update to move life along has steadily increased exponentially with less stress thanks to YOU ALL who have cared and contributed. Again she thanks you with hugs. Gillian is able to do things more independently visit with friends periodically and has had the endurance over the last 3 weeks to keep up a hectic schedule with drives to multiple doctors’ appointments each week in Los Angeles. During a visit with her breast cancer surgeon it was strongly recommended that Gillian freeze her eggs immediately as she would only have one opportunity prior to chemo. She and Eddie made the decision to freeze embryos for stronger viability. This process entails multiple injections daily that Jilly must give herself in the stomach and multiple weekly appointments with the fertility specialists where measuring the progress of eggs takes place. Gillian was able to receive a grant from LiveStrong Fertility of Hope Program because she is a cancer patient and this reduced the out-of-pocket expense for this process to a bit over $8000. In addition to these weekly visits she also saw her surgeon and her mastectomy reconstruction surgeon in order that her incisions and drains are monitored and that the mastectomy expanders are slowly filled. Add to this a whirlwind trip Monday eve to Colorado to meet with her oncology team who specialize in young women's breast oncology at the University of Colorado. They discussed the various cocktails for chemo treatment and then she returned to LA the following night to continue with her other doctor appointments.The plan is that the eggs will be harvested early next week; she will have one final visit with her reconstruction surgeon and then return to Colorado immediately for chemotherapy and to resume work.We will keep you updated as her progress continues. Again we thank you so much for your kindness generosity and continued support. Your contribution prayers love and positive energy are allowing Gillian to keep moving forward with the best possible care stay positive and fight. + Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Mandy Anderson 23 months ago Share REALITY CHECK...Good news: Gillian was FINALLY released from the hospital Monday night and is now at her parent's home in California. It could go without saying that there is considerable pain but Gillian is a fighter and determined to increase her tolerance and work-arounds. 1st post-op was today; 2nd is next week. Not so great news: Chemo and radiation are both necessary and simultaneous beginning within a month. So it is going to be a very very long road ahead. What we didn't know are the not covered costs associated with chemotherapy treatment. Round 1: a cocktail of 2 drugs for 4 sessions. Round 2: 1 drug for 12 weeks. Each chemo treatment is only covered 70% leaving Gillian out-of-pocket approximately $310 per visit. Then there is the rental of a cool cap and apparatus to prevent hair loss ($3600) and the rental of Theradome ($1090) to increase any hair thinning or some loss. Lastly home care/physical therapy that will be needed outside of the allotment.While her energy level isn't what you are used to her enthusiasm to rid this disease is at an all time high. Gillian reemphasizes how grateful she is at the outpouring of love and thanks you again and again and again.+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Mandy Anderson 23 months ago Share With initial surgery complete we have some answers. Gillian can sit up and even took a small walk. Gillian is still in the hospital as she is having quite a bit of pain. The hope is that she will be released on Monday to her parents to continue her healing process over the month. At that time the doctors will determine whether she is ready for chemo therapy over the next 5 months with radiation to follow. The plan is the doctors in Los Angeles will continue to direct her recovery. The hope is that Gillian will be able to fly to Colorado for her chemo sessions and fly back to California for intermittent follow-ups.+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Mandy Anderson 24 months ago Share Wow! Speechless. We have officially reached 50% of our goal in 24 hours. I've spoken to Gillian and Eddie since this campaign went live and I wish I could capture how humbled and thankful they are by your donations and messages. Both of them have genuinely communicated how overwhelmed they are with the love and support that has been poured out on them!I'm happy to announce even better news surgery was successful and Gillian is in recovery surrounded by Ray Jenni and Melissa.

       " \"Update 7 Posted by Marci Fassel 36 months ago Share 11 Hi! Another Long month of treatment has past for Kelly. She has now completed the 2nd stage of Treatment (the consolidation phase). Now we are waiting for her ANC (her combined white blood cell count- calculates risk of infection) to go up. We need it to be 750 or higher before we can start treatment. Tuesday it was 10 Thursday it was 30 Sunday it is 90.Kelly was admitted to the hospital on Thursday for a continuous low grade fever and for persistent vomiting. Kelly in the past couple of months has lost 10-15% of her body weight which is significant because she is so tiny to begin with. We have put her on medication to help increase her appetite and we are working hard to control the nausea. Kelly is doing a bit better and they are going to be sending her home tomorrow assuming her ANC is above 100.In the past month Kelly has had 2 transfusions of platelets and one transfusion of Hemoglobin. She is likely going to get another transfusion of Hemoglobin before she goes home tomorrow. Kelly turned 16 on Feb 27th! This was not the 16th birthday we had envisioned for her. She was happy to not be in the hospital. But she was too nauseous to fully enjoy her Birthday. The doctors on her treatment day came in singing Happy Birthday and gave her a cake. Very sweet! We did manage to have a little fun this month we went to Colorado Springs and stayed overnight and had a mini break. We are finding the mini breaks from our difficult reality are important in reminding us that we are still living inspite of Cancer. Kelly got a remote control car for her Bit day and she has quite enjoyed driving it all over the hospital! The hospital is becoming our 2nd home. Kelly is learning to take advantage of all it has to offer: Bingo Crafts Teen Room The Fish tank meeting Disney Princesses. The next phase High Dose Methotrexate will be in patient treatments that will have Kelly in the hospital 3-7 days (or more) depending on her reaction to the Chemo. In theory it will be every other week. However in order to have treatment your ANC must be 750 and Chemo lowers that. At this point we have been delayed 2 weeks already for the 1st round. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was a week or two more. The unpredictability of her treatments makes it very challenging to juggle work and parenting. We learned this time around that as much as we want to be with Kelly 24/7 when she is in the hospital. This is not always possible. We are grateful for the amount of love and support people have shown us. We couldn't get through this difficult time without it. We truly appreciate all the different ways people have reached out to help us. It reminds us in this challenging time there is still a lot of good in the world. Please continue to pray for our family and Kelly's recovery. Thanks Again! Sarah (Kelly's Mom)Kelly's 16th Birthday! + Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Marci Fassel 37 months ago Share Kelly is currently in the hospital. In the past week we have had quite a Rollercoaster. We have made 3 trips to the ER for a fever over 101 and severe headache. But we were sent home on 2 of the occasions because her ANC ( risk of infection) was above 500. The magical number for being admitted. ..or not. We have Also had a spinal tap and treatment. Her 4th one this month. After her treatment on Wednesday they kept her for observation. They were concerned that she might have menegitis because there are white blood cells in her spinal column. A possible sign of infection. Her MRI indicated that she is fine. We stayed in the hospital until Thursday night. 2 hours after being home Kelly began to get a fever. By morning it was 101.7. By the time we were at the hospital it was 103.7. We were admitted again on Friday. 10 hours at home. Kelly has now tested positive for Rhino virus. Which is the common cold. She is very sick. She has a friend visit today for 2 hours. She has no memory of the visit. They are pumping her with fluids and antibiotics. She can't take her medicines orally right now. She can't keep anything down. She has essentially not eaten in over a week. Kelly's ANC is 40 today. Her hemoglobin was 7.2 so she is getting a transfusion as we speak. She had a transfusion 9 days ago. Today I (her mom) got sent home frim the hospital because I had a stuffy nose and might be getting Kelly's virus. It is extremely difficult to not be there with her when she is so sick. Kelly has had much more trouble this month with depression and coping with her illness. She feels like she is going to have no life for 2 1/2 years until she out of treatment. She is doing a bit better now. But it is an ongoing struggle. another thing that has been challenging this month is I have had to give Kelly shots at home 3 days a week. They were painful and upsetting for both Kelly and me. Please continue to pray for Kelly (and us). Kelly does like visitors even if she doesn't have much energy. Sometimes she might only be up for a 5 minute visit. BUT she misses her friends and family. So please continue to visit. Even if she doesn't show it. .. That helps a ton. Ross and Kelly shaved their heads togethKelly and me on a treatment dayKelly in the ER+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Marci Fassel 38 months ago Share Another quick update. Today Kelly got her blood test to see if her ANC was at a 750 or higher so we could begin the next stage of treatment tomorrow. Her numbers were good... But not good enough. Her ANC was 644 (great for Kelly). We were excited because this would give Kelly a week without Chemotherapy! No such luck. They now want us to bring her in again Wed for a blood test and then Friday she will hopefully start the consolidation phase. This was supposed to be the week we cut back to one trip a week. So. . Far this is not what we are experiencing. Flexibility is the key to all this. We are learning to not plan on anything! I am so grateful that we own our own company so that we can change our schedules as needed. I had Monday light for doctor's appointment. Tuesday cleared. Now I need to clear Friday and clear wed morning. Kelly's platelets are 355--great numberhemoglobin 10 okayKelly is enjoying the week Pretnizone free! She is beginning to get less bloated! Her face is starting to look more like Kelly. Her pain is less. We are enjoying a few days with less Chemo. It is a good break for Kelly. Sarah(Kelly's Mom)+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Marci Fassel 38 months ago Share Kelly is starting to struggle with keeping her spirits up. She is exhausted all the time and in constant pain. She is done with it all. .. And she has just begun. We know it will be worth it. On Tuesday December 222014 Kelly officially finished the induction phase of treatment. And the very exciting news is that she is in Remission and shows no signs of minimal risidual disease. So we will continue on the very high risk protocol as scheduled. Kelly's number's are pretty good. She had a transfusion which helped her hemoglobin rebound and her ANC is also looking good. Over 600!!! She has to be above 750 ANC to start the consolidation protocol. Secretly I would like her numbers to be close to it but not quite there... So that she can have a lonet break from all the meds... And perhaps she could feel a bit better before the next round of Chemo hits. We had a different Christmas. Kelly was not well enough for really any of our family traditions. There were a lot of tears of frustration on Kelly's part. She really finds it hard to not do the things she enjoys. She misses her friends. Kelly did go to see Dixie 2 times this week. Once to celebrate being in Remission. Got a 5 minute ride. And on Christmas wished Dixie Merry Christmas. .. The highlight of her Christmas.

Helen had another major surgery on April 6th 2015. She is still in the hoispital as her pain is very bad. We are hoping she will come home tomorrow. Its going to be a very rocky road ahead for us and she will need 110% full care. Helen was suppose to start radiation but her Dr's said that she needed to have all the surgery done. This has now pushed her back 12 weeks.Lets hope this is the last time she will have to go under the knife.Despite all the pain she is going through her spirits are very high.My Go Fund me is still on so if you would like to donate you can do so. If you do not wish to donate online you can mail a check in Helen Ward name address: 14085 S.W. 144th Ave. Tigard Oregon. 97224.Thank you every one. You all have been so good to Helen.

Following my chemo treatments will be a bone marrow transplant. I will of course update everyone along the way. This chemo treatment is called consolidated therapy.

       " '\"Update 5 Posted by Cory Poole 13 months ago Share \"\"The things that matter most in our lives are not fantastic or grand. They are the moments when we touch one another when we are there in the most attentive or caring way. This simple and profound intimacy is the love that we all long for. These moments of touching and being touched can become a foundation for a path with heart and they take place in the most immediate and direct way. Mother Teresa put it like this: In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.\"\"I love that passage. It\\'s from a book called A Path with Heart by Jack Kornfield. So much truth in it simple truth. It also correlates so well to what we\\'ve done here so far. Not one of us did anything grand or fantastic here. We all did small little somethings with great love. From our hearts. All those small little somethings the donations/sharing/praying/etc... have added up together to be something fantastic and grand. Not just for Tony and the family either. They are why we\\'re doing it but we\\'ve all gotten something special out of this. A sense of being a part of something special and bigger than ourselves. Thanks to all of you for supporting this campaign to help this amazing family who is so deserving of all our support. Thanks to all of you for this feeling I\\'ve had this past week watching this immense love pour out for my friend and his family. Thanks most of all to Tony and the family for opening the door to let us do it. They inspired all of this in us.It\\'s been about exactly a week since this campaign started. In just a week we\\'ve raised about $57500 from 502 different donors. The campaign has been shared over 1700 times on Facebook. The GoFundMe page has been visited over 34100 times. Just yesterday there were 1661 visits to the page. It\\'s just extraordinary.The Huml\\'s are just blown away by this. Tony finally mustered the courage to visit the GoFundMe page to see the amount raised on Friday. He didn\\'t even really know what to say he just cannot believe it. He kept saying he just feels so blessed. When he began to read the comments from the donors he broke down. You all have touched his (and the family\\'s) heart in a very special way. Thank you so so much.We\\'re not done yet though! There have been and will be more news stories coming out. Please don\\'t stop sharing the campaign and talking to those you know about what we\\'re doing and why. Every little bit helps no matter how small.+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Cory Poole 13 months ago Share So we\\'re about to hit a pretty crazy number in just over 3 days. $50k. It\\'s just unbelievable and is clearly a testament to Tony and the lives he has touched throughout his life. If you have the time to read some of the messages from the donations please do. It\\'s special.I\\'d like to think that this story Tony\\'s story the family\\'s story is something that would be quite interesting to the news outlets in Janesville and the surrounding area? Can we get some awareness of this story out there to them somehow? Would the Janesville Gazette be interested? Would one of the local news channels be interested? Does anyone involved in this campaign know someone who could help with this?If you do please reach out to your contact. If you don\\'t but you\\'re inspired enough to reach out to them anyway please do. This is just a remarkable story one that could reach and touch even more people. Could someone help with that?We\\'re at over 1.5k shares now. Can we reach 2k before this is over?Thanks again to ALL of you. Everyone who has donated shared prayed etc... Any and all of it is truly appreciated by the family and is what has kept this thing going.+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Cory Poole 13 months ago Share Wow what a past couple of days! I knew we\\'d be successful but this has just been amazing. Thanks to everyone who has donated shared prayed etc... Any and all of it is very much appreciated by Tony and the family.Lets keep this going. I know of at least two other people/groups out there doing some fund raising on their own via outlets they have access to for the Humls that were inspired by this campaign. That is a product of not only the family and how great they are but also word of mouth sharing of the campaign etc... The more people we can make aware of this the more we can do for the Humls.One challenge we could take on is sharing of the campaign. According to GoFundMe what leads to the most success of these campaigns is the sharing of it via Facebook. We\\'re at 1.4k shares so far which is just amazing. Could we hit 2000 shares before this is over?Again thanks to everyone who has been involved. They are forever grateful and just blown away by the love and support you\\'ve shown. Lets keep that going for them!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Cory Poole 13 months ago Share 11 This is just unbelievable! The love and support everyone is showing for the Huml\\'s is absolutely incredible. Thank you all so much!As of last night Tony had not mustered the courage to go online and look to see how things were going. He was very hesitant to allow us to do this for them. Very hesitant. Wish I could be in the room when he looks to see not only the number but the personal messages from so many lives he has touched over the years. My favorites were the ones from his past students.I told him while we were giving and supporting them the real gift was from him to us. He gave us the chance to express our love and generosity. He inspired it in us. He gave us a chance to feel good to feel like we were a part of something much bigger than ourselves. We all need that in our lives we feel more whole if you will. I know I felt connected yesterday to something special. I\\'d like that feeling to continue.Can we keep this going? Can you share the campaign again? Can you reach out to others in your circle or your area about this wonderful man and family who needs love and support at this time?I think we can. His employer Breakthrough Basketball got involved yesterday. I reached out to Paul Ryan yesterday via Twitter to see if he\\'d give us a retweet. I\\'d like to think we\\'re just getting started :)Much love to all of you for your help.

       " '\"Update 6 Posted by Dominique Ward 15 months ago Share All we are in need of a 175 people to donate $60. That would take care of the remaining treatment I\\'m in need of to return home Cancer Free. That would equal just a little over $8500 after Go Fundme take their fees out. The money would cover the last week of treatment which is $5500 the CT or PET scan which is $1200 some meds I\\'d need and hotel fee. After we pay for next week\\'s treatment we will have exhausted all funds that have been donated and my savings. We are so close to the completion of our goal to returning home healthy and I can\\'t give up now. We\\'re still trusting and believing God to see us through. I know many of you have donated and we\\'re forever grateful for you. We\\'re asking that you share this with as many people possible if you\\'re unable to support. I understand the season wholeheartedly and appreciate any support rendered. We also have an account with Wells Fargo for those who don\\'t want to donate to gofundme. Inbox me for the details. So again I want to thank each and everyone of you that have helped make any of this possible words can\\'t express how grateful and thankful my family and I are for all of you.

We want to make sure it has time to heal before starting chemo. So the following Monday which is July 13th 2015 he will start his five days of chemo. Thank you so much to everyone who has donated. All the love and support we are receiving has helped us so much already. Please keep sharing and thank you for your prayers. + Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Theresa Elsenheimer 32 months ago Share This is from Brandy Swanson...Sorry it took so long to post. We wanted to talk with our children and family first. So today was very hard for us to process. We have a very hard road ahead but we know we can beat this still. Scott is going to Lacks Cancer Center Thursday to have a chemo port put back in. Then on Monday July 6th. He will be going back to Lacks Cancer Center as an inpatient. He will be there for five days and receive very aggressive chemo for 120 hours straight. It will be through his port (The entire 5 days). After the five days of chemo he will be able to come home for two weeks and have to get between 3-5 blood transfusions during this time at the Cancer center in Reed city. After those two weeks he will go back in for 5 days of chemo(120 hours) and then be released again for two weeks well maintaining the 3-5 blood transfusions at the Cancer center in Reed city. Then after that he will go back in one last time for another 5 days and (120 hours of chemo). Following this they will keep him in the hospital and begin a different chemotherapy to take away all his bone marrow. They want to wipeout his system completely. Then they will do kinda like a dialysis to take his stem cells out of his blood. They will begin shots of Newpagin (it painfully grows bone marrow) and then do a transplant on his chest placing his stem cells back in him. It is not considered a stem cell transplant. It is considered a new way... of a bone marrow transplant. That is why they are trying to wipe out all his bone marrow. We are still trying to process everything and are just going through the motions right now. Thank you all so much for your love support and prayers. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 32 Posted by Iman Sri 16 months ago Share Hey everyone. I wanted to provide you all with an update. After my initial bilateral mastectomy back in January every few months I\\'ve had to have surgery. Yesterday Oct 20 I had another surgery. There was some complications. What we thought was only necrotic tissue was also a large cyst in my cancerous breastso the surgeon had to cut it open and drain it. Meaning they couldn\\'t complete every procedure originally scheduled; therefore I have to have another surgery. Was suppose to have my post op on Nov 1 but the surgeon wanted to discuss my next procedure sooner because he knew I was extremely devastated about having to have another surgery. So that appointment will be next week. Exhausted and in pain but I will make it through this one as well because \"\"this too shall pass\"\"! I\\'m tired of being cut on and in constant pain for months at a time. My spirit has gotten weary. I\\'m not asking for donations but I am requesting prayers. Many people believe that once you\\'re \"\"in remission\"\" that it\\'s all over and but it is not. I\\'m learning to live in and love this new/different body. Cancer permanently impacts a person\\'s life forever. I appreciate all your love and support.+ Read MoreUpdate 31 Posted by Iman Sri 24 months ago Share When I had absolutely no hair I just wanted my hair to grow back! Plus it was much cooler so I stayed cold. In my humanness I complained that my hair wasn\\'t curling up. What may seem minor to some is major to someone else especially when they\\'ve undergone major physical transformations. I had to ask God to forgive me for complaining and be grateful for what I do have. So this \\'wild baby hair\\' that is growing from my head I\\'m learning to love it because it\\'s all apart of the \\'new me\\'! Thank you God for everything you have done currently doing and will do. I am beyond grateful. + Read MoreUpdate 30 Posted by Iman Sri 24 months ago Share 11 Today is Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day!! Many of you have been following my journey. I was diagnosed with TNBC 6/19/16 a day I\\'ll never forget. I remember the doctor telling me not only did I have TNBC but also that it was the most aggressive type of TNBC. This has been such a long journey physically mentally and emotionally. I\\'m working on healing completely and staying as healthy as possible but I promise not to become one of those \"\"health snobs\"\"! Thank you all for your continued support. Here are a few facts about Triple Negative Breast Cancer. What you may not know is that TNBC is not \"\"normal\"\" breast cancer. A few facts of TNBC for you...??Only 10-15% of breast cancers are triple negative??Lacks 3 receptors that fuel most breast cancer meaning there is NO pill to take to reduce risk of reoccurrence ??More aggressive than other breast cancers and warrants a higher risk of reoccurrence??Poorer outcome for the first 5 years than ER/PR/HER2 BC.Triple Negative is a beast! We want to create awareness continue research for new innovative treatment and provide support for others who are dealing with this!+ Read MoreUpdate 29 Posted by Iman Sri 24 months ago Share Life doesn\\'t stop just because something major happens. For example the week of my surgery while I was in the hospital my rugrat got strep throat! Killed me to not be able to cuddle my baby but grateful for family who stepped in. Fast forward to this past weekend. My incision opened up creating a large hole in my leg. I\\'ve experienced all kinds of pain but THAT was some kind of awful. Guess what though life kept going. While I\\'m home trying to get my leg better my little rugrat contracts pink eye in both eyes. So it\\'s my sweet baby and I at home eating junk food taking our meds and watching Disney movies. I\\'m human so I had to ask God to forgive me for my moments of frustration.

       " '\"Update 8 Posted by Connie L. Smith 5 days ago Share I just got off the phone with Lisa and she\\'s as buoyant as ever; no matter what comes her way she manages to turn it into a hilarious anecdote. Late last year just before the holidays she started some specially-targeted physical and occupational therapies to help her with post-chemo/radiation arthritis issues that were affecting her spine (most all of her joints really) but especially making it hard to use and move her hands. Her hand therapy involves immersion in warm wax baths and while time-consuming she says those therapies continue to be very helpful. But her ability to sit and work is not just relegated to hand issues; it\\'s the spine and posture exercises and strength training that are also key and this is where the anecdotes come in which Lisa relates with spectacularly visual language: in one she has been instructed when going out for her walk to really extend her stride and sway her hips so as to increase the flexibility of the leg tendons that attach to the pelvis and bolster the strength of the lower spine. \"\"If you do it right\"\" she says \"\"it looks just like Marilyn Monroe walking her sexy walk on the silver screen — she must have had very limber bones!\"\" And so I began giggling visualizing Lisa out on the street in Springfield in her apron and sneakers \\'sashaying through the neighborhood like Marilyn Monroe...\\' and before I could recover my composure naughty Lisa (who by now knows that I\\'m helpless with laughter; even she\\'s starting to giggle at this point) launched into her full anecdotal glory describing how \"\"as if all that weren\\'t enough\"\" she also has to \"\"lie on a mat on the floor and attempt to place my left knee into my right armpit and then vice-versa in the name of all this strength and flexibility training.\"\" [--At this point I\\'m wiping tears away and trying not to wet my pants from laughing.] Then she adds \"\" I tried to do this on my bed and fell off. Twice. So now I do it on a mat on the floor. Poor Allyson has to pass me to get to the kitchen and she sees this stuff from a rather bird’s eye view. I\\'m glad I don’t have any idea of what she’s seen — I might just die of embarrassment.\"\" [--So yeah this is what generally happens when I call Lisa to check in on her and \\'cheer her up.\\' She makes me laugh so hard I generally just leak mirth at her expressiveness. She\\'s always been a very visual thinker and clearly her tribulations have not diminished that aspect of her skill-set one bit. If anything they\\'ve enhanced it. And so I share.]Earlier this year she had some recent swelling in the affected breast which she had feared might be a relapse of the breast cancer. The best news is that the breast cancer appears to be gone so YAY! for that! The less than great news is that it turned out to be lymphedema (a delayed reaction to the strong radiation she\\'d been on) and she is currently on a wait list to receive special lymphedemic massage therapy in addition to the PT & OT that she\\'s receiving for her arthritis issues. All of these therapies take up a considerable portion of her day but they are ultimately worth every minute she says because they afford her those precious chunks of work time when she can continue to sculpt.Lisa is still battling red tape to secure some limited Social Security benefits in the wake of all this tumult which would be an enormous relief for both her and Allyson. In the meantime she has been able to offer some limited private lessons out of her home and hopes to continue that practice ultimately refurbishing Jerry\\'s old writing room into a guest studio and salon.While Lisa has been victorious in her battle against breast cancer thus far her battle to keep making her art in the wake of radiation and chemo after effects (Lymphoma / Lymphedema / Arthritis) will be lifelong. She has already proven herself a fierce Warrior Queen armed with Patience Fortitude and a Ready Wit... and the friendship love and support of all of you who\\'ve donated so far.From the bottom of my heart Thank You All so very much for rallying to her side and for continuing to ask about her and donating whenever and whatever you can in spite of my more recent distractions.+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Connie L.

Lisa was almost hospitalized for the radiation burns which resulted in the sloughing off of skin in the area and a deep infection. She has developed arthritis from her waist down as a result of the chemo so sitting to work is painful. In spite of ill health and pain she has 3 pieces of art ready to find new homes. Her will and stamina are amazing. Huge thanks to all who have donated and shared. Could you find a way to donate $20 or $25 more ? Blessings and love to you ALL!!\"\" [--thank you Kat for reminding us all that help doesn\\'t have to be gigantic to be HUGE.

I just spoke with her again earlier this week and in true \\'Lisa\\' form she began with THANKING me (and by extension all of YOU) for this GoFundMe campaign and when I asked her how she\\'s doing she did that thing she always does: she spun her troubles into wry anecdote that made ME laugh.

Even when she\\'s passing through a dark valley herself.

First of all our plan HASN'T changed we are still going to try an alternative treatment. Last Wednesday my mom got discharged from the hospital to be under hospice services in my apartment here in San Diego. We didn't take her directly to Tijuana because we wanted to avoid any difficulty crossing the border in case of an emergency besides the initial plan was to start the alternative treatment this upcoming Thursday.Unfortunately my mom keeps getting back to the ER due to irregular health issues. Today has been the scariest day of my life. This morning while my mom was under my care for the very first time in her life she suffered two seizures. At 10:05am I started noticing a strange behavior on my mom her sight was lost pointing all the way to the top of the ceiling and she was lucid for brief moments. Suddenly she turned her head abruptly to the left side and started shaking; I freaked out and my immediate response was to call 911. By the time I started giving all the details over the phone giving my apartment's address and trying to be calm at the same time my mommy started doing strange noises with her mouth because of her lack of oxygen and started biting her tongue to the point that her eyes went blank. Today I witnessed my mom's first seizure. After the paramedics got home and started assisting her she happened to experience a second seizure. The 2-3 minutes that elapsed felt like the longest wait time in my life. Luckily we made it really fast to ER and my sisters were there already waiting for us to arrive. My mom got a few CT scans and x-rays from her brain and lungs. The doctor's found out that her brain tumors are growing and the swelling from that area of her brain triggered the seizure. Once again my mom seems to be a little more stable now taking strong pain medication and a new medicine in order to prevent seizures. Rain or shine we're taking her back to Tijuana no later than Thursday HOME is waiting for the four of us to make our last try and fight against this disease. My mom is very disoriented she is no longer aware of time dates people or places. She can't keep up 100% conscious and her memory is deteriorating rapidly. She constantly asks for her family members which are already on their way to visit her tomorrow. My mom is fighting like the BIG warrior she is and has set plans to make it home awake. A lot of family has been amazingly supportive with company for the four of us. My dad grandma aunts sisters and I are making everything possible to have her under comfort and trying to please her for every little thing she asks for. At this point we're ready to see a miracle happen and we've been actually seeing it happen since my MOM is already a miracle and a cancer survivor. Family and friends we're moving as fast as we can and even faster to help my mom accomplish her last wish; FIGHT.We're even more united than ever asking you not only for financial support but for more prayers than ever we believe there's no other powerful weapon than to use our prayers to win a battle. I'm asking every single person who texts me or messages me to pray for her. We want this to become a chain of prayers for Isabel Cristina so that she doesn't suffer any longer during this difficult time and to bless every single hand and medication that touches my mom's body. We're leaving everything on God's hands not without mention that we're doing everything we can do for her. My sisters and I are today and from now on 100% at my mom's service and needs there's nothing more rewarding than to see a smile on her face every time she glances back at us. Please help us by sharing this miracle and testimony. We're extremely grateful for helping us accomplish my mom's last wish and we thank you for taking the time to be part of this chain of prayers for her.+ Read MoreUpdate 3 Posted by Steph Gomez Vargas 7 months ago Share Hello supporters family and friends!Mom has been unstable because an alleged blood infection doctors have been doing blood culture tests. She's been having antibiotics for that bacteria and it looks like the last blood test they took was sterilized which means clean. They're still doing urinal labs for any bacteria residue on her body this procedure is done by using a catheter directly to her bladder.Last night she just started with a new unbearable pain on her low back which has complicated things a little she suffers a lot for being laying down or even sitting down anything that touches this area put her under a lot of pain she describes the pain as burning inside and outside.Unfurtunately the only medication that keeps the pain away is morphine which nocks her down and make her being somnolent all the time.These things have been delaying our plan on her alternative treatment since she have to be stable in order to receive it. We're hoping that she gets better at least to be discharged from the hospital and move her where ever she will receive this alternative intravenous treatment.It's been a hard week for her because she suffers a lot with these cancer pains which are and will continue to be normal since the spine is obstructing some nerves causing her pain.We thank you all for your support we have been receiving a lot of blessings and we have no words to thank that! Mom still strong enough to fight and me and my sisters will continue to be here supporting her with so much love and giving her many more reasons to stay alive.Here is a picture of her under the morphine effect at least she get to rest and sleeps well. Thank you all and may God bless you and yours! + Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Steph Gomez Vargas 7 months ago Share Hello all we've made this video to share with you the LOVE that my mom represents to us the love that even under this hard circumstances she's still been able to give.This past weekend was a roller coaster my mom started with a new symptom; fever. This was caused due to an infection in her urinal tract. It was scary how her temperature got so high for 2 days in a row and her blood pressure very slow. Unfortunately most of the weekend she was under a lot of medication causing her dizziness somnolence and nausea. She was asleep most of the time. As every weekend she got visit. Her sisters came to support her and give us company during these hard days. My mom is being incredible strong doctors are surprised of how my mom keeps that much enthusiasm and positive attitude. All nurses ask to have my mom as their patient during their shifts here they say that my mom is the sweetest patient and that she have such a good vibe. They love to see her smile and are extremely attentive with her needs.As we can see we haven't reach our goal to pay for her alternative treatment at the private clinic but we're so close we feel and know that this will be possible.We have so much hope and believe that she will be strong enough to win this battle again.We're amazed of how many people has given us such great support. All these donations prayers text messages phone calls and this campaign's shares have given us su much hope we know we will fight and my mom will beat cancer for the 3rd time.Our plan is to start this alternative treatment ASAP but she needs to be stable in order to be discharged.We've singed papers for a hospice nursing facility since that's the next stop doctors have told us to do.But we want to let you know that with God's help our prayers and your support we will continue with my mom's las wish; FIGHT.We're extremely grateful for all you've done for us.

It would've been difficult to keep up the treatments had she not had the extra help. I just wanted to share an update on her treatment and progress. Sarah has been getting her IV treatments twice a week in Kingston ON since late July. For the month of December she is continuing her treatments in Albany as her Doctor in Canada is out on maternity leave. She had her first treatments in Albany this week under the care of Dr Heidi Puc who is an integrative oncologist at the Stram Center. We had originally thought Sarah would be finishing up treatment around this time but Dr Puc recommended that Sarah continue the treatments for 6-9 months because of how aggressive the tumor was. For now she will be continuing treatments until the spring. She is also waiting on results for Lyme disease testing (her dr thought she had many of the symptoms) an oncoblot test which can determine if cancer proteins are present and she will soon have a bone scan and PET scan to determine if the cancer has spread. These things will help to monitor her during her treatments. These test results will determine her next steps and as always we're hoping and praying for the best outcome. Though she's had some hard times Sarah has continued to stay positive despite how exhausting all her appointments travel and treatments can be. Again thank you so much for all your support as Sarah continues to fight this disease. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers and I will update as we find out more. Thank you!Sarah at her IV treatment + Read MoreHelp spread the word! Share Tweet 1.1k shares on Facebook\",\n",
       " \"Update 2 Posted by Cassie Pennell 1 month ago Share I am sorry it has taken us so long to post another update but here it is. We received the results from the genetic testing and unfortunately they came back inconclusive. They were not able to identify the gene mutation in any of the embryos. They looked at the 3 successful embryos as well as 5 others. They should have found the mutation in 50% so because they didn’t find it in a single one they can not say for certain that the embryos do not have the mutation. This was definitely very frustrating to hear after spending so much money and getting our hopes up to have an answer. Going forward the only way to know for sure whether the gene mutation is present will be to do prenatal testing such as an amniocentesis after we have conceived. Again we would like to thank you all for your support through this difficult time we are so grateful for each and everyone of you!+ Read MoreUpdate 1 Posted by Cassie Pennell 6 months ago Share Hey everyone Mike and I are finally ready to share our first update. We have completed our second cycle of IVF are are excited to say we had 3 successful embryos. 2 of which are really good quality and 1 that is average to poor. All three have been biopsied and sent to Genesis for testing. We should have these results in about 2-3 weeks. I am hopeful that possibly the reason so many didn't make it could have been because of the gene mutation and maybe all 3 embryos will be negative for TP53 but for now we just have to wait and see.

Leading up to last week she had not been able to receive chemo in several weeks due to hemoglobin and platelet counts being off. Rhonda had began to swell in her arms and legs along with extreme shortness of breath. Once at MUSC they reviewed the scans and performed some other tests. Several teams of doctors met together and then met with Rhondas family and close friends. We met with a 27 year old doctor named Dr. Carley Anderson this past Thursday who was absolutely remarkable with the family. Dr. Anderson explained how TNBC is very  very aggressive and due to that the mass had grown significantly large in a short amount of time. Due to the size of the mass it was putting pressure on her heart and lungs making it difficult for Rhonda to breathe. She explained that chemo would not be an option due to the platelets being low and more harm than good and radiation could not be given due to the fact that the mass being so close to the heart. Surgery to remove the mass was mentioned but due to the location it could be fatal and if surgery was successful not sure if Rhondas lungs would be strong enough to come off of ventilator. This was tough for everyone knowing that there were 4 boys who were counting on their mother. Johnny and Rhonda met with the oldest 3 boys later that afternoon and each of them were told the situation at that point. They have surrounded their mother continuously since hearing this news and we have all turned it over to prayer and Jesus Christ. The familyalong with options from Dr. Andersonthought it was best to move Rhonda to the Hospice House in Georgetown so she could have quality time with her family and friends. Johnny is the only income that family has at this time. There are 4 boys that love their mother dearly and need to spend this time with her as well as her husband. Johnny is having to leave the Hospice House and this treasured time to go to work and Rhonda doesn\\'t like this but she knows that this has to be done in order to pay the bills. Please if possible... Show your support and help this family remain together during this time. A price tag can\\'t be put on these days to this family its everything they have at this time..... Please continue to pray for Rhonda Johnny and most importantly the four boys who love their mom. + Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Johnny Ward 34 months ago Share It\\'s been a while since I posted an update on Rhonda so here goes. Since her mastectomy on her right breast Rhonda had a spot come back on her right side in the area where her breast was. It waso determined that it was cancer and she has undergone 3 weeks of aggressive radiation with her last treatment coming this Monday the 4th of may. She has also been taking a pill firm of chemo along with the radiation. The combination of the two have made her very tired and feeling bad. She is a trooper and has been coping with it as best she can. Once she is done with the radiation she will have scans done to see how well the radiation has done and will start intravenous chemo again next week. As always your prayers are very much appreciated please keep them coming. Thanks!!!+ Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Johnny Ward 36 months ago Share Since Rhonda\\'s surgery she has had 2 more of the \"\"red devil\"\" AC chemo treatments. She has done well with the chemo treatments  but the shot she has to take the day after treatment makes her feel miserable at times. She will now begin a new round of chemo that will be 6 treatments followed by her 6 weeks of radiation (5 days a week). Then 4 months after radiation is complete she will have her other breast removed and have reconstructive surgery! We ask that you keep us all in your prayers.

       " '\"Update 8 Posted by Brian Jubitz 33 months ago Share This is Brian\\'s mom. Brian finished his sixth treatment without any problems. We though we were in the clear when he started vomiting had headaches and eye pain. We were scared because the symptoms were similar to the ones he experienced when he was diagnosed with CNS Lymphoma. I phoned the neuro oncologist who was sure it was not due to the tumor. We monitored him through the weekend. Brian\\'s vomiting stopped the headaches subsided but still had slight eye pain. Brian has to have blood drawn twice a week after treatments for two weeks. On our way to the blood draw Brian threw up. Of course we weren\\'t prepared so at a stop light Brian opened the car door and let it rip. I phoned the doctor who ordered a CT scan. Brian was readmitted to OHSU for MRI and further testing. Brian suffered a small stroke. After MRIs and other tests the doctors found two blood clots in his cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for balance & coordination. The blood clots occurred as part of the procedure. Luckily Brian did not suffer any deficits and can walk and move without any problems. The swelling and clot is pushing on the center that controls motion sickness hence the vomiting.After a night in the hospital Brian\\'s home resting. He was starting on aspirin once a day to reduce swelling and to prevent blood clots. Brian hates taking medication but realizes this is what he has to do.On an up note the tumor is shrinking the treatments are working.Thank you for your continued thoughts prayers and continued support. Love to all.+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Brian Jubitz 34 months ago Share My nephew just started chemo treatment #5!

Please send him messages to cheer him on during his battle! May is brain cancer awareness month! #grayinmay#grayinmay+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Brian Jubitz 35 months ago Share Brian finished his fourth treatment (eight more to go) last Friday. The treatments went well without seizures (yea) and vomiting. His hair is thinning but the nurses don\\'t think it will get any thinner.The tumor is shrinking but it\\'s difficult to see. He has blood in his brain from the surgery not to worry however it shows up as white on the MRIs. The problem is that tumors show up on MRIs as a brighter white. So it\\'s difficult to differentiate between what\\'s tumor and what is blood. Drs. Neuwalt Ambody Paolo Netto and someone from Hungary (too many vowels to pronounce) aren\\'t concerned. They said the significance is the doctors will pronounce him as \"\"tumor resolved uncertain\"\" instead of \"\"certain.\"\" He went on to say there is a woman who has the same condition and has lived 30 years one of his first patients. Brian has eight more BBBD treatments from what we can see the blood is also shrinking. Don\\'t know if we mentioned the BBBD team consists of four neuro oncologists one nurse practitioner and two nurses. All arrive at the same time for rounds each morning and afternoon while he\\'s in the hospital. Crazy! Brian is tired not sleeping a little achy from the white blood cell shot and no nausea. The insomnia will resolve once he stops taking the steroids which will be on Friday. Scott\\'s home this week and keeping him company. He has an opportunity to go fishing Friday so finger\\'s crossed. Brad will have to drive him since the doctors say local driving is ok no road trips.On the plus side Brian has contacted a man from the Reno area who was diagnosed with Primary CNS Lymphoma 17 years ago when he was 23. He has a very physically active life and has a foundation which raises money for people 18-35 who need assistance with college tuition after chemo treatments.

I had a grand mal seizure lasting 40 seconds during the treatment. Seizures are not unheard of but can happen. I don\\'t have any lasting effects from the seizure but it freaked my mom out.I am nauseated for about a week after each treatment cannot sleep because of the steroids. My hair is thinning but not sure if it\\'s from the chemo or genetics (thanks Mom). I have blood drawn twice a week for two weeks then once a week until treatment. So far everything looks good.Good news - my tumor has shrunk about 40% with the treatment! It\\'s working. The doctors told me I will have to undergo out-patient chemotherapy every 2-3 months for 1-2 years once the 12 treatments are finished. Additional treatments improve the remission rate exponentially.I have met some great people through this experience. Nurses doctors cancer survivors cancer fighters.We got the bill for my first treatment. It\\'s higher than what we were told. The treatment is working which makes it worth it!

       " \"Update 7 Posted by Sharon M. Thomas 34 months ago Share Boy have I been a busy person. I was discharged from the clinic (transplant group) on March 30 and was able to go back to my home from isolation. It was fantastic to go to sleep in my own bed and have my cats to love on. I also thoroughly enjoyed the alone time. Don't get me wrong about going through this treatment and having 24 hour caregivers for two months but I have been living on my own for a long time and had really started to miss some alone time. I still would go back and do this again if it meant kicking Lymphoma's butt like I just did!!!!! Another great piece of news was that I would be allowed to work from home as I cannot go back into an office environment until I am at least 100 days post transplant. I found out that I have a new boss and with the expansion of my department I don't have an office cube to go!!! They have been aware of my return date so I should be finding out where I will be sitting soon!!!! I now have my home office up and running and am working a full 40 hour week. Feeling great and getting stronger everyday. My hair is just now starting to grow back in. I'm very excited to see what it is going to look like. I am counting down the days until June 18th when I will be able to go out into public work and just do the normal activities.Unfortunately while being able to go back to work I have exhausted all of the money raised to date. It all went to my temporary living expenses caregivers and immediate medical expenses. The serious medical bills are starting to come in and combined with my regular living expenses I will not have enough money to go around.

They currently total over $300000 but will not be submitted to my insurance company until I am fully released from BMT. I will be praying that I have excellent coverage.

First of all I would like to thank all of the kind and generous soles who have contributed to my page.Since I last updated my page several events have occurred. First of all my transplant was a success!!!!!! Then things went down hill from there. This was to be expected.I couldn't swallow my pills nor eat so I had to be admitted back into the hospital for I.V. pills fluids and nutrients. I actually lost my voice as well. Everyone who knows me got a kick out of this. Because I was also retaining water I became very familiar with a bed pan. If I never have to see one again I will be a happy duck. One week to the day I got to go home to an even bigger issue. The heating/AC unit in the bedroom soaked the carpet. Two comped nights and a phone call later I had a new place to stay.This was a walk in the park compared to what came next. Last Thursday I developed a tightness in my chest and back which I initially thought was indigestion. Well I was partially correct. 4 EKG's and another trip to the hospital two things were discovered. One is that I have a slightly irregular heart beat and that after an ultrasound I developed another blood clot in my lung. So Lovanox is now my best friend again. I also have an appointment with a cardiologist later this month.Now for the great news!!! I hit 21 days tomorrow! I may get to have this weekend off. Still no word on when I can move home with my cats. But I will continue to roar!!!!Please keep the prayers and any contributions coming my way. + Read MoreHelp spread the word!

As many of you may know Jake is now in remission from his cancer however the struggles still continue... this is a conversation between Mary and I regarding Jake's continuing condition: Overall the JRA (including the uveitis.. the arthritis attacking Jake's eyesight) has been a challenge after the chemo treatments we needed to find another medication to keep the JRA/Uveitis in check. Jake has had several infusions every 2 weeks over the last 5 months 5 steroid shots in his knees and ankles to relieve some pain and allow him the ability to just walk. We just started a new infusion and hoping this one will work. This medication alone is 10/11k then we have the hospital stay or home nurse expense. We are also on new medication for his CF that helps his defective gene work better which is the cause of the disease. This is exciting since is working toward a cure. This medication is 19k per month The drug companies do have programs to offset some of the cost that insurance will not pay but they do not cover them completely. As always Jake is living life to the fullest but we need to keep constant maintenance and prevention up for the cancer. Jake currently under goes regular blood work scans new infusions for JRA drops for the Uveitis physical therapy daily breathing treatments and medications while trying to get his weight up to catch up to his fellow 6th graders.

       " \"Update 3 Posted by Rebeccah Lutz 6 months ago Share Hi everyone - James and Kim are keeping everyone updated on his progress via Facebook. Here is his latest update as he continues treatment.8.14.17You get what you needThat was my theme from last week. I truly believe God calls and desires us to tell Him what we want. Through prayer we have a strong connection to the Lord and I know He loves to deliver our wants and desires. But sometimes He only gives us what we need.Throughout the week last week I made my desires and requests known to Him but God gave me what I needed. He needed to let me know that not everything that I ask for is a requirement to achieve success. My biggest request was to return to the same floor that I had been on during the initial induction phase of my treatment 3S. During the month long stay on that floor I built a lot of great relationships with staff and felt comfortable on the floor. I called the admitting office at Moffitt several times the week prior as well as the evening before to request to be on that floor. When I arrived on Monday morning I had a gut feeling that I wouldn’t be on 3S and it was confirmed upon my arrival. I would be in 4N which is the only other unit that you can receive chemo treatment at Moffitt. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I knew it was an attack by the devil and rather than wallow in misery and being angry I decided to try to make the best of it. This could be an opportunity or a failure.The good news is the week went very well. I had an opportunity to talk with several new nurses share my stories from the previous treatments and my goals for health and faith life. It turned out exceptionally well and thus I have several new nurses to be thankful for and who are praying for me. There is also a room on the 4th floor that has every type of gaming system with a huge TV and board games to play with the kids. I had a great time going to the room (not quite a daily basis) to play some MADDEN kill aliens and race some fun cars I’ll never have a chance to race in real life.With each round of chemo I also have a lumbar puncture to determine if the cancer has crossed the blood/brain barrier and to put some chemo up there. The procedure itself usually isn’t too bad (considering there’s a huge needle inside my spine). This would mark the 6th time that I had an LP and there is a clear winner in who I prefer to have complete the procedure. The first nurse to complete the procedure seems to have “knicked” a nerve during the placement of the needle which gave me a SUDDEN sharp twinge down my leg. It was immediately gone but still freaked me out. So much so that the ARNP who completed the procedure just a few days later remarking how sweaty I was during the procedure (because of how nervous I was that it would go badly). In that 2nd procedure I prayed the entire time and asked God to let the procedure go well. Since the 2nd procedure all the LPs have been smooth and truly painless and something that I don’t mind. As I’m being wheeled down for the LP last week I’m starting my prayers and asking God for a smooth procedure and for the “good” ARNP to be the one to complete the procedure. Sticking with the theme of the week it was in fact the nurse who did the procedure first. I’m very thankful that the procedure went well and was over quickly because the needle was up against a nerve and was making my right leg go numb. If it had taken any longer this post might be a lot different.As I received the news on Thursday that I would be discharged from the hospital I got the “unfortunate” news that due to a certain medication still being present in my system we would have to wait to finish up the week’s treatment until Saturday afternoon. Of course there would be another wrench in the week but there wasn’t anything that could be done. I went with it because that’s what God wanted me to do. This gave me a chance to visit with the wonderful family who has graciously allowed us to stay at their house while we’re down in Tampa. It gave me a chance to rest and recuperate and spend time playing with my family. It gave me a chance to spend time on Saturday with my mom who came over to sit with me during the treatment.Life won’t always be perfect. You’ll be cruising along and something will come up it’s just bound to happen. You can either go with it or get stuck. I again am so thankful that I have so many supporters prayer warriors and soldiers fighting with me in this battle. I could have easily been in poor spirits last week and still to this point but there’s no need for it for me. In the words of Kid President: There’s too much awesome to be spread this week!+ Read MoreUpdate 2 Posted by Rebeccah Lutz 9 months ago Share Thank you to everyone who donated to help James Smith and his beautiful family as he undergoes treatment for leukemia at Moffitt Cancer Center.

His cancer is too aggressive and despite 6 rounds of intense chemo the leukemia continues to attack his body. There are no more viable options left as far as treatments go. The doctors want to discharge him this week so that he can go home and enjoy time with his family and friends. The only possible option left is to try and see if someone at MD Anderson will take his case and enroll him in a clinical trial. However he may not be eligible for any trials due to his ongoing lung infection. This has been a long and hard journey but we couldn’t have done it without everyone’s overwhelming love and support. James is not done fighting. He is ready to keep giving this everything he’s got. If you’d like to see him please feel free to contact us about visiting him at home. If there’s one thing we’ve learned throughout this journey is to love and cherish your loved ones like it’s your last day. Every day we are so thankful for being alive and having such an amazing support system. Thank you and we love you endlessly. Love Ari James & his family.+ Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Ariana Gabás 5 months ago Share Hey guys. It's been a while since I posted an update on here. As you know after 3 rounds of very intense chemo James went into remission. However he acquired a serious lung infection that delayed his stem cell transplant. After he sort of recovered from the lung infection and he was cleared for the transplant he received consolidation chemo to suppress the cancer cells. Since chemotherapy basically kills his immune system his body is extremely prone to any type of infection. After he was given the consolidation chemo he acquired another infection that almost cost him his life. This infection caused a trip to the E.R. and he was eventually admitted into the PCU (progressive care unit) to be monitored closely. When he arrived to the E.R. his temperature was dangerously high his heart rate was at 165 bpm and his sepsis level was extremely elevated. Meaning he was going into septic shock. His amazing doctors and nurses were able to stabilize him and after two weeks he was discharged. A week later he was scheduled for his transplant and we were very excited to finally make progress towards his recovery. Three days before the transplant was scheduled he received a bone marrow biopsy that showed that he is no longer in remission. The cancer is so aggressive that it became resistant to the chemotherapy and the cancer came back stronger than ever. He even has more cancer cells in his marrow than when he was first diagnosed. Because of this he is no longer eligible for a stem cell transplant. We were devastated. We were so close to the finish line. There is nothing worse than being told that the cancer is winning. Since there haven't been many advances in treatments for Leukemia James has pretty much exhausted most of his options. His doctors decided to administer one more round of chemo that consists of drugs he hasn't been given before. The doctors also looked into clinical trials and other treatment options but unfortunately he is not eligible due to his ongoing lung infection. We are hopeful that this round of chemo will work and we trust that he will soon be in remission and on his way to getting a transplant. Although it's been a rough couple of months we could not have gotten through this without all of the love and support we've received so far. We are forever grateful for each and every one of you. Much love Ari & James+ Read MoreUpdate 5 Posted by Ariana Gabás 8 months ago Share Hello everyone! In my last update I announced that James was undergoing a third round of chemotherapy in order to try to get him into remission. After his third round of chemo James was finally able to go home after being in the hospital for a total of 72 days. He was so excited to finally be home with his family! I am also so happy to announce that James is finally IN REMISSION!!! His doctor confirmed that they didn't see any Leukemia cells in bone marrow!! We are so thankful and excited for these amazing news. The last chemo was very brutal and James was definitely at the lowest he's ever been physically mentally and emotionally. But he is so brave and strong and it was absolutely worth it! As you may know James' journey with cancer does not end here. His best chance at beating Leukemia is to get a stem cell transplant. We are also pleased to announce that they found an even better 10/10 match! The next steps that he will take towards his treatment will be getting all of the pre-transplant tests so that he can finally get the transplant. Since his cancer is so aggressive we cannot wait any longer and the transplant must be done as soon as possible. I want to extend a deep thanks to every single person who has supported us unconditionally. We could not have done this without all of the amazing support we've received so far. James' doctors and nurses have also been amazing and they have made James' hospital stay much more bearable and enjoyable. We are so unbelievably thankful for all of the donations prayers comments and support. The amount of love that everyone has given James has given him motivation to keep fighting through this terrible disease. We are one step closer to beating cancer and we couldn't have done it without you!!! As always I will continue to keep everyone updated on James' condition as he begins this new step in his treatment. + Read MoreUpdate 4 Posted by Ariana Gabás 9 months ago Share James' Fight Against Leukemia has reached 50% of its goal.

       " \"Update 12 Posted by Ashley Phillips 28 days ago Share Time for a quick update!Once again thank you to everyone who has donated and helped out Jamie and her family in anyway. Jamie has been doing really well. She is in her third week of radiation and has about 3 1/2 weeks to go. She is handling it very well so far. Once radiation is finished she will move on to either a clinical trial called Olympia or a different chemo pill called Xeloda. Currently she has expanders in and they will stay that way until about 3-6 months after radiation. After that she will be able to have her implants! Yay!! Here are a few recent pictures of the family. Please keep Jamie in your prayers and keep sharing this page! ????????????+ Read MoreUpdate 11 Posted by Ashley Phillips 3 months ago Share 11 Sorry it has been awhile since the last update. Jamie has had her bilateral mastectomy and expanders placed. She is currently seeing her plastic surgeon weekly to fill the expanders for her reconstruction. She will be having radiation in about 4 weeks. She will be having it 5 days a week for 6 weeks. After radiation she will most likely be having more chemotherapy. This time it will be pill form. The reason for the added chemo is that they found that when they did the mastectomy there was still 1cm of cancer left behind which means the chemo worked but not fully and it being a very aggressive cancer they want to be aggressive in treatment as well. After the chemo is when the reconstruction will take place. She is handling everything the best she knows how and for that we are super proud of her! Jules is growing up so fast. She is happy and healthy. She is so beautiful. Thank you so much to everyone that has donated and or shared. Jeff and Jamie are so thankful for all of the help they have received. Please continue to share as she will be out of work for a while longer as the treatment has been extended. Happy Thanksgiving ??Jules and daddyMommy and Jax+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Ashley Phillips 5 months ago Share Just a little update for everyone. Jamie finished her last round of Taxol last week making that 16 total chemo treatments! She is scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy in late October so keep her in your prayers. Being that she tested positive for the BRCA 1 gene which is hereditary we figured it obviously came from either her mother or father. Well once again she has something rare. Very rare. She has wha is considered De Nova. Meaning anew. Her DNA started this mutation less than 1% have this. The company that tested Jamie her mom and her dad want to retest them to make sure it is correct. This changes nothing in the way of treatment or prognosis. After the mastectomy she will have radiation.Jamie has been dealing with all of this like a champ. She is a wonderful mom who dedicates as much time possible with her 2 little ones. Jules is a smiling happy baby now. 4 months old! We will have another benefit for the Gruntmans on October 14th at the Waiting Room bar in St.Ann. Please come out if you can and support this wonderful family. The link is below. Once again thank you so much to all who have donated it really means to world to Jamie and Jeff.

Jamie had her third treatment of Taxol last week. She has 9 more to go! Taxol has been a bit rough for her  just pain and weakness. But she is a trooper. I think the hardest part for her is juggling being a mom going to treatments being tired but wanting the kids and trying to have a somewhat normal life. Her Mom being there is such a huge help she is so positive and takes such good care of her baby and her baby's babies:). Jeff has also been a huge help with everything from going to work taking good care of Jamie and the kiddos. She is blessed for sure. Jaxon is such a wonderful big brother who loves his sister so much. Please pray for Jamie through these next treatments that she can gain a bit of strength. And once again thank you so much to everyone who has donated or shared this page. Please continue to share as obviously there will be plenty more expenses in the future once her surgeries start. ????????Mommy and Jules - so in love ??Oh so precious!!+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 16 Posted by James Thompson 22 months ago Share 11 Aloha Family and FriendsUpdate #16: In the clear...again!We just reached the 9 month mark since Jamie finished treatment and he traveled to City of Hope yesterday for his third three month check up. We are ecstatic to report that HE IS STILL N.E.D. - NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE! At the check up in January we learned that Jamie\\'s thyroid isn\\'t functioning so well due to the chemotherapy and he has had to add thyroid medication to his daily routine. A low functioning thyroid is a common side effect of radiation and chemo in the head and neck area. The symptoms include low energy irritability etc. We noticed that Jamie was getting really tired each afternoon and was pretty much grumpy on a daily basis. After starting the medication though he started to get back to his normal fun-loving self.Our January trip was a double check up at City of Hope. For those of you that don\\'t know in December Jessica was discovered to have a 2.5 inch mass in her neck near the thyroid. We know....how is that both of us have had a mass in our neck in the same year? She had a biopsy and thankfully the results showed that it was benign. Nevertheless we weren\\'t taking any chances and scheduled a second opinion with Jamie\\'s doctors at City of Hope. They were a bit shocked to see us both there for a visit. Our amazing team of doctors there got us in for her appointment quickly and diagnosed Jessica with a benign thyroid nodule (actually three of them) and offered to re-examine the biopsy slides (which is still underway). They told us not to worry and that her condition was not related to Jamie\\'s cancer or treatment. Phew!!! We are so grateful! We were completely freaked out there for a while around that time. She\\'ll go back in July to have another look and make sure the nodule isn\\'t growing.Sometimes it is easy to make our journey sound rather easy and light-hearted. As I\\'m writing this I can hear my own optimism infusing my words. You may have noticed that our updates have become less frequent. Partly that is because we\\'ve tried to get back to a \"\"normal\"\" life where cancer isn\\'t \"\"top-of-mind\"\" on the daily. We\\'ve jumped back into our jobs more than full-time. It\\'s almost as though the universe is providing us with distractions. The other part is because of our second scare and the indescribable fear and worry we underwent. Unfortunately we know that this is a byproduct of having survived cancer. It is always on our minds and life will never be the same. Every three months we are reminded as our check up approaches that we are still on this road...like the grief of cancer is still following us. It\\'s like you are rowing upstream and if a bird flew above to watch you he\\'d see the stream just behind you darkening and ever encroaching. I think this is also the feeling because of how many people we know who are battling this hideous disease. It\\'s like everyday we learn of another friend entering the battle field. Our heart aches for them and yet we got through it...are getting through it. Prayer is constant that humanity and those we know and don\\'t know can get through this scourge - emerging brighter and healed. We are still processing the experience and it is showing us that life really is a journey not a destination. We need to take time to stop and appreciate all of our days...the good ones and the \"\"bad\"\" ones. They are all just here for our learning. Through it all we know we must keep the faith. Faith in love and a higher power and ourselves.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for holding us in your prayers and supporting us through our journey. We are eternally grateful.LoveJessica Jamie and Bodhi+ Read MoreUpdate 15 Posted by James Thompson 27 months ago Share 11 Aloha Family and FriendsUpdate #15: Thanksgiving came in October for us!Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Once again getting back into life after cancer has been somewhat challenging. Thank you all for your patience in receiving an update. For those of you not on Facebook our trip to California at the end of October was amazing....Jamie is cancer free!!! We cannot describe to you the relief and joy we felt on our third day of tests at City of Hope. Jamie had a series of tests - first a PET/CT scan and MRI then blood work and finally and endoscopy. The results were awesome! In the PET Scan...nothing lit up. Jamie\\'s blood work was totally normal and his body has rebounded from the harsh chemicals. His radiated lymph nodes are still healing but Jamie\\'s pain has gone and his taste buds have recovered. We enjoyed our final meeting with our radiologist who had the look of total smugness with his expert work on our case. Go ahead Doc...be proud...be smug...you deserve it!!!We got back to Maui after this momentous trip full of joy and jumped right back into our busy life. As those of you who have experienced this disease or any illness life does not stop just because illness strikes. We are still playing \"\"catch up\"\" for the 5 and a half months we were in California for treatment. We are so grateful for the opportunity to play \"\"catch up\"\" at all. So grateful for this life we get to live together.It seems that everywhere we turn Cancer shows up again. We\\'ve become aware of so many more friends dealing with this hideous disease and many more than that we don\\'t know but we pray for nonetheless. Some are still battling and living in love and some have gone home to god. Recently Jessica lost a colleague to cancer and the feelings of loss and grief are immense and the feelings of us survivors so complex. All we can do is make everyday count make our success count and live a life full of love integrity and purpose.We still face challenges but again are grateful to be here to face them - Jamie now begins the two years of follow-up every three/four months. He\\'ll travel to City of Hope again in January/February for his next check up. Many people wonder why he has to go so often for two years! The experts tell us that with Jamie\\'s type of cancer those who experience recurrence see it within the first two years. Once we can get past two years with no recurrence then we move to a 6-month schedule. Then after a year we move to a yearly schedule. We feel strong and determined to get through the next five years with NED - No Evidence of Disease. Thank you for praying for us.During this season of thanks-giving we pray we can pay Jamie\\'s cancer-free status forward to those individuals still battling. Although our medical bills are our next battle...we are healthy...we can work. There are others battling for their lives. Others whose families have to be separated in order to get the treatment they need. We\\'d like to ask our friends and family to consider giving to those people at this time.Maui has a special family here on a serious journey to save their little man\\'s life. Little Trucker Dukes is in New York battling a rare childhood cancer. Please take a moment today to learn about this family and consider giving your support. Let\\'s lift little Trucker and his family up in our prayers and help them have a fighting chance...a chance to experience the joy of NED we\\'ve recently experienced. You can learn more by visiting: https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/yxp6/baby-trucker-dukes-cancer-fundWe are so grateful for life and so grateful for all your love. Happy Thanksgiving everyone! We love you!Jamie Jessica and Bodhi :-)Mahalo City of Hope!Jamie\\'s beard and taste buds returned!+ Read MoreUpdate 14 Posted by James Thompson 29 months ago Share 22 Aloha Family and FriendsUpdate #14: Adjusting to our new realityThank you all so much for everything you\\'ve done for us these past months. We apologize for the delay in posting an update but the last two months have been a whirlwind.We arrived home on July 26th to a group of smiling sign waving friends. It was truly a joyous homecoming. When we got to our house we discovered that some of our amazing friends had secretly cleaned our house and put up a welcome sign. They even placed soaps and goodies in the bathrooms! Later that night we celebrated by watching the Maui sunset at Kamaole Beach Park III with friends and family. It was such an emotional day and we felt the love of so many who have been rooting for us. One of the odd experiences of our homecoming was arriving to our house. We almost didn\\'t recognize our home. It\\'s like we had detached from our belongings when faced with life or death. We got the message that we already knew which is that all our \"\"stuff\"\" really doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s about each other and our loved ones...period. Even though we\\'ve been home now for awhile we are still discovering our house and clearing out junk and focusing on the essentials in life.The following two weeks Jamie took it easy and continued to rest at home while Jessica returned to work to get the school year started. Bodhi started school and is doing well. It seemed like an easy transition but then Jessica became ill in early August with a severe case of Bacterial Pneumonia and Pleurisy and unexpectedly had an anaphylactic allergy to the antibiotics. Talk about a triple whammy. It took the Maui doctors awhile to diagnose her but once they did the healing could begin. She\\'s doing better but even 7 weeks into the situation she is still healing from the pleuritic pain and coughing. UGH! Many people continued to help us during this time. Jessica\\'s dad Dan stepped up to care for her so Jamie could get back to work. Our friends here also brought food and kept the school running smooth. Thank God for all our beautiful friends and thank you to those of you who helped with your prayers and love.The good news is that we feel we are both on the mend. Phew! Jessica is back to work and Jamie has been back to work and is feeling pretty darn good. He is starting to get his taste back and his saliva is improving. The skin on his neck is totally healed and his beard hair is slowly returning. The only weird side effect he seems to have right now is really sore skin in places and some nerve pain. We are looking into whether he may be having possible thyroid side effects from the radiation and chemo.On Oct. 19th we\\'ll be back at City of Hope for his first scans post-treatment. These scans and tests will tell us if the treatment was successful. We are expecting success and are already dubbing our future travel \"\"The All Clear Trip\"\". Please help lift us up in the \"\"All Clear\"\" energy for complete and total healing.We will post again once we are in California to give everyone an update. Mahalo nui again for your continued prayers and love. We are so very grateful.Love and LightJamie and JessFinally feeling better!The Welcome Home CommitteeSunset at Kam III with good friends+ Read MoreUpdate 13 Posted by James Thompson 31 months ago Share 11 Aloha Family and Friends:Update #13 - Homeward Bound!We made it to the finish line of treatment! Jamie is our superman and he finished like a champ! Round 3 of chemo was postponed by a few days and more immune booster shots or rather blood cell boosters were given. Then on Monday he was cleared for the last round. Due to the side effects of ear ringing from the first two rounds they switched the medication to prevent further hearing issues. This round was shorter by many hours and Jamie didn\\'t even have time to paint. The week closed up with the last 3 radiation treatments. The effects of chemo are still hanging around and Jamie\\'s not feeling so hot but he will rally.We were so touched by the team at City of Hope. The end of treatment at City of Hope is celebrated and after chemo the nurses sang \"\"zippity doo dah my oh my it\\'s a wonderful day\"\" and gave him a medal. After radiation the team cheered for him and also gave him a medal. We celebrated too by giving lei and Hawaii treats to Mahalo everyone we could. It was a deeply moving experience to share Aloha with them and many tears were shed. We felt all of your energy too and you should know your love and prayers have been shared with many others at City of Hope.Tomorrow morning we get to go home to Maui and move forward with the healing process. We are excited to get home and see all our Maui \\'Ohana and try to get back to some normal activities.We will be traveling back to L.A. often for tests and follow up. In October we come back for our first follow-up and re-scan. It will be during this visit that we get to see how the treatment worked. We are expecting and praying for a cancer-free scan. Please keep up the prayers for that!We\\'d also like to ask you to prayer for others at this time. We\\'ve met so many wonderful families who need all the love and healing thoughts they can get. Please pray for our new friends and all those we passed in the halls at CoH fighting the battle . There are countless people who are just like us and there are no words to describe how special they all are and how much we are so grateful to have crossed paths with all of them. Cancer doesn\\'t discriminate - it affects us all in some way. Your love and support of us has changed us forever and kept our focus on what really matters in life - LOVE FAMILY FRIENDSHIP HOPE HEALING LIFE!We\\'ll keep you posted as we settle back at home and watch Jamie heal up! We\\'ll also keep you posted on our journey for the follow-up. They say we have to come in every three months for two years. We are grateful to have you on this journey with us. Thank you to our Maui folks keeping up the vision of tomorrow\\'s journey home. Thank you to our L.A. family who have cradled us with love and support in countless ways. And thank you to ALL of you for the love prayers and financial support. We could not have done this without you all.With LoveJamie Jess and Bodhi+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " 'Update 9 Posted by Monica Krebs 1 month ago Share 11 It pains me to be back on this page talk about flash backs... phew! Using this avenue to get help puts us in a vulnerable uncomfortable position. Asking for help especially when it comes to money hasn\\'t been something we do as we both are very independent. However the RI and Maine systems and programs that have been set up to help people like Jason have failed us. I have been fighting for Jason to receive these state benefits for over a year now without success. As a social worker this is extremely discouraging. I smiled as I told Jason when he woke up from sedation that we would be okay and not worry... there are so many programs and systems set up to help people like you... we will be fine. I was wrong every. single. day. has been a battle. Phone calls emails mail lost paperwork the back and forth is relentless! The process has been confusing aggravating and down right maddening! Jason has worked full time since he was a teenager he pays taxes and pays into SS but has been denied these benefits that he rightfully needs and deserves. Can you imagine how upsetting and angering that is for Jason?! Someone who was at the wrong place at the wrong time... someone who was protecting his loved one he is my hero and he has been called a hero BUT he isn\\'t getting the help a hero deserves. He continues to suffer after his selfless act. It\\'s crazy all the news articles sensationalized his heroism but now that time has passed none of that matters. This trauma didn\\'t end for us after the shooting we sure wish it did but it has continued due to the broken systems. Although Jason isn\\'t quite ready to go back to work as he continues the healing process he is still an active member of society as a full time student with a 4.0 GPA amazing I know! It hasn\\'t been easy for him but his efforts and dedication show in his grades!This gofundme has gotten him through this past year and we couldn\\'t be more thankful for all of the family friends and strangers who were generous enough to contribute. You made it possible for Jason to have food a place to sleep heat to stay warm... the basic needs and more! So we again thank you from the bottom of our hearts for that help! However we are again asking for you to open your hearts and consider donating or sharing our story because we desperately still need your help due to these system failures. We are still hopeful that he will get help we are just unsure how much and when. Until then the bills continue to pile up and the bank account dwindles as the phones ring off the hook.My mother has graciously assisted us with taking a short vacation next week and we have put aside money that was gifted to us for birthdays/holidays to make this trip possible. Our mental health needs this trip but it\\'s hard not to feel guilty or selfish about doing this for us due to our financial situation. However we truly need this time together a break from reality and a break from these persistent stressors because it has been one hell of a year for us both. We need to continue to work us our well- being and mental health. I look forward to us getting to the place and time in our lives where we are thriving rather than surviving until then I WILL keep fighting and appealing these systems and programs even if it means involving the Attorney Generals Office in hopes of their help! I thank you for taking the time to read this and I thank those who donate and share. You truly are helping us get out of this seemingly endless hole that the shooting and 6 figure medical bills has buried us in! Also please know that we pay it forward when we can - we have used our own gofundme money to donate to other causes we have rescued a puppy we also fostered a puppy made clothing and household item donations among many other ways of giving back!

We want peace we want to be formally committed we want to start a family and don\\'t want this trauma to crush our goals and dreams! + Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Monica Krebs 13 months ago Share 11 UPDATE: Jason had his last follow up with the surgical team at CMMC on Thursday. The hole that opened at the incision site has recently stopped draining!! And the hole is healing quickly it has been actually quite fascinating to witness. We decided to take a couple more Maine adventures before headed back but we will officially be back in RI tonight. We were able to pass out multiple thank you cards to all of medical personnel who have helped from the beginning - from the Med flight nurses on the rescue to the Bridgton Hospital ER team and the various teams of people from Central Maine Medical Center (surgical trauma ICU T-1). The recovery road isn\\'t over he still has limitations. Jason lost 25lbs in addition to his strengthen and endurance. Thankfully Jason and his advisor were able to switch all but one his classes to online courses. This will be beneficial to Jason while he builds his strength and endurance back up. We haven\\'t been home in 2 months!Another transition more changes and additions to the to-do list BUT we are headed home right before Jason\\'s birthday! We again thank everyone for the continued support through each transition bump in the road and for celebrating the successes of healing. You all are awesome keep up the positive vibes for this next transition. Shawnee Peak after dusk+ Read MoreUpdate 7 Posted by Monica Krebs 14 months ago Share UPDATE: 1/5/17: Welp! it has not been an easy day and a half. Yesterday we had a busy day of back to back home visits from the state detective in-home team including: nurse PT and OT. As the day went on Jasons temperature climbed. We also noticed the site where the liver drain tube was had began to \"grow\" and as of Tuesday it had stopped producing discharge. Yesterday redness hardness and a yellow pus type lump formed to the point it was protruding out. In addition redness and hardness around site increased. This am we woke up to this site exploding soaking a super gauze sponge an hour. This discharge had various colors/textures of fluid coming out including some blood. After consulting via phone with the nurses and PA on the surgical team at CMMC they decided we should come in. Before leaving home we put fresh dressings on for the commute to the hospital and we noticed the area where the retention sutures and stitches once were (removed this Tuesday) had also started draining a large amount of a similar fluid. Once arriving the PA who has been working with Jason from the beginning sent us to the ER to have a CT scan and lab work (blood/urine) done to rule out an abscess/infection. We also noticed a hole (smaller than the size of a pea) had formed at the top of the abdomen area where stitches once were.We are glad the team here is proactive and listened to our concerns and his symptoms. Unfortunately it seems whenever there is a good day with good reports and evidence of progress it is followed by days of steps back bumps in the road or hiccups... As I\\'ve kept saying this isn\\'t an easy or quick recovery road being that Jason was in a life threatening state for a period of time. In addition to the physical aspect of this recovery we were hoping to spend some time together within the beauty and nature of Maine. While up here being in nature would assist in the coping and healing process for the mental and emotional effects of this trauma but these hiccups are delaying that process as physical recovery comes first!We again would like to say how thankful we are for the family who has opened their home to us. Although we are almost an hour from the hospital/team that has been caring for him this is better than hours away in RI!! Please continue to share donate and PLEASE keep sending positive vibes and thoughts our way! Thank you everyone!!!1/5/17: Urine and blood work have been taken... he is drinking the contrast liquid for the CT scan over the next hour then has to wait an hour. He will also have an IV of this contrast. Next he\\'ll have the CT scan and we will wait for results recommendations... so about 3 hours till we know anything... if it is an abscess he will have to be re-admitted to the hospital 1/6/17: Blood test urine test and CT scan came back inconclusive. Jason was prescribed 2 antibiotics. No one seemed to be concerned about the hole that was getting bigger where the stitches once were and where drainage was leaking. Jason was discharged from the ER around 1am.1/6/17 We woke up to the hole in his abdomen being bigger. This was concerning because it was large and you could see inside keep gross! So the surgerical office had us come in again... for the third time this week! The surgeon PA nurse and med assistant all examined. It was determined that the drainage is due to superficial infection hence why he was prescribed 2 antibiotics yesterday. They soaked up and irrigated that hole. They also packed the hole with this stuff called silvercel they pack the gun shot holes with this a well... it worked great. It helps heal the wound/hole from the inside out by soaking up any fluids and treating any possible infections. The silvercel has been be changed daily and the gauze on top should be changed as necessary (drainage wise). Packing the hole is a bit out of my scope as I don\\'t think my stomach can handle that! The in-home team was faxed instructions and they will come out Saturday and Sunday to assist with this. We will go back Monday to see the PA in the surgerical office so they can closely monitor the hole and it\\'s healing. Where the feeding tube was and where the liver drain was are no longer draining One step forward two steps back seems to be the infamous line of all of the medical professionals assisting in this process. We are hopeful things will get easier physical healing wise so our focus can be moved directly to the mental and emotional healing process of this trauma. Both Jason and I are people with good work ethic so it is difficult to be out of work and collecting TDI. This puts a burden on us financially as we don\\'t see our whole paycheck and mentally it isn\\'t easy either as we both want to be working we like being productive and active citizens! We want our life to be \"normal\" again but we are trying to accept the fact that this will take time. I had officially moved in with Jason early fall and unfortunately due to life stressors we hadn\\'t even finish unpacking or organizing our loft apartment. Being that we haven\\'t been home since before Thanksgiving we also will be coming home to the shambles of our place. This all is far from easy but let me tell you Jason and I\\'s love bond connection continues to grow stronger and I know in my heart and my mind that will get through this...Picked us up some smoothies - Pineapple Express and Heavy Duty Fruity - added CBD oil and protein! + Read MoreUpdate 6 Posted by Monica Krebs 14 months ago Share UPDATE: Today Jason had a follow up appt with the awesome surgeon and PA who completed 4 out of 5 of the surgeries. He had blood work done to see how well he is doing with nutrition on his own. They were happy with how this looked said he should continue to try to eat more... specifically protein. Since these results looked good they removed the feeding tube the last tube! This site will leak/drain for a few days while this track area heals itself. They also removed the last two retention sutures in his abdomen as well as all of the stitches in his abdomen. The site where the liver drain was has stopped draining as of today this is showing that that track has healed up. All other wound sites tube or bullet all are healing nicely without issue. Jason Almeida is so happy to have his abdomen area back to \"normal\" without the uncomfortableness of the tubes and retention sutures. He still has some pain but this continues to decrease majority of his pain seems to be in the area where the broken rib is located (from the path of 1 of 4 of the bullets). Jason will have the last follow up appt with this same PA and surgeon January 19th. Following this we will make our way back to RI within the next few days. We would like to thank everyone again for the continued support. The outpouring of love and support from friends family and strangers has been uplifting. It gives us hope after experiencing a crime this violent. So many people have reached out to offer verbal support people are donating sharing our gofundme page coming up to Maine to visit us sending us care packages... it\\'s just amazing. We can\\'t thank you all enough. We can\\'t do this alone. We are beyond thankful for the family who has opened up their home to us. We are beyond grateful for them and their generosity. Not only is it a warm safe home in a beautiful area of Maine but they as a family are by far the kindest people we have ever met. They are also fun loving and supportive. Their sons provides some much needed comic relief and is absolutely adorable! Jason and him have formed an awesome bond! We love them!The physical aspect of this recovery road may seem like it\\'s almost over but Jason will need to work hard to get his body back to where it was when he was snowboarding skating hiking and surfing. This won\\'t happen overnight... nor will our healing in terms of managing and coping from this intensive trauma - mentally and emotionally. I am thankful for my grad school education and training specifically in trauma treatment. Having this knowledge and experience has proven to be helpful and effective in assisting us. We are a team and we will get through this it won\\'t be easy but we will be stronger individually and more connected as a couple. We chased the sunset down yesterday as we were needing time in nature... to calm our souls and heal our minds.+ Read MoreHelp spread the word!

       " '\"Update 11 Posted by Jenny Bassett 25 months ago Share For those that haven\\'t already read my blog to receive the latest news I regret to share that my cancer continues to progress. While on Abraxane at least two of the innumerable tumors in my liver have grown considerably in size. Today we switched my chemo drug to a more aggressive one that tends to put a lot of strain on the heart. I had a baseline echocardiogram and my ticker is strong going into this! The plan is to get this drug once a week for three weeks then have one week off. I shared with my oncologist my wish to take my son to Disney. This will be the first family vacation just the three of us since Frankie was born and I was diagnosed. I cannot wait to see the joy on his little face! We\\'ve got a lot of planning to do in a short amount of time since my oncologist made it clear we ought to go sooner rather than later. When we return he is pulling out the big guns and putting me on a much more aggressive form of chemo that will ultimately wipe me out for weeks on end. We\\'re at the point of having to choose between quantity of life and quality of life. I thank all of you for helping me to live fully and with so much love and laughter! I\\'m so eternally grateful for the ongoing support (both emotionally and financially) that have helped my family and I to maintain some semblance of normalcy and also to cross off bucket list items such as Disney. Much love and many thanks-- as always!!!! xoxEnjoying a late morning snack with my favorite lil man last weekend+ Read MoreUpdate 10 Posted by Jenny Bassett 27 months ago Share Well what can I say? My doctors and I were shocked to find that my cancer has progressed after only recently seeming to have gone away. There was no evidence of disease in my liver just three months ago and now there are too many lesions to diagnose. They are all very small (2cm or less) but they are plentiful. I will receive the results of the liver biopsy within the next few days to determine the biology of these tumors and the best course of action. Due to the amount of progression I have already resumed chemotherapy; this time a drug called Abraxane. As of now I am scheduled for two weeks on one week off. Which means I\\'ll be spending the morning of the 24th in the hospital. On the bright side my folks are flying in from FL to spend Christmas Eve with me even if it is in the hospital we will still make merry! I cannot thank everyone enough for the continued love and support through all of the ups and downsAll drugged up after liver biopsy+ Read MoreUpdate 9 Posted by Jenny Bassett 29 months ago Share 22 It\\'s been too long since I\\'ve shared an update especially given all the good that\\'s been happening in my life!My trip to Europe was phenomenal! Special thanks again to my dear friend Lisa May for making that dream a reality. We had a wonderful time in Rome - the Colosseum and Roman Forum were unbelievable. One of my favorite parts of the trip though was the last night in Rome which we spent at the hotel sipping wine (thanks again to our friend Katie who called the hotel ahead of time to gift us a bottle!) and reminiscing about our college days. We had so many laughs then and I am so please that we can pick up where we left off and continue the laughter to this day.Paris was also beautiful and I enjoyed stretching my brain back to high school French coursework to attempt to speak the language. The people were very patient with me and appreciative that I at least made an effort! We saw most of the major landmarks -- Notre Dame at night was my favorite! -- and enjoyed so much of the culture (and wine!). After Paris I flew to Denver for a conference hosted by Living Beyond Breast Cancer (the same organization that trained me back in June to become a young advocate). I loved seeing a few of my fellow young advocates and making some new friends. I learned about some advancements in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and came home with a list of topics to discuss with my oncologist. Today I met with my oncologist and cannot stop smiling. My most recent CT scan showed no evidence of disease in my liver! My spine is stable with no progression. We talked about recent clinical trials - the Penelope trial to be specific -- and I am excited to announce that we are adding Palbociclib to my treatment regimen. When combined with Letrozole (which I am currently on) Palbociclib was found to have doubled the median progression-free survival. In other words I will hopefully stave off progression of my disease for a longer period of time thereby allowing me to have a better quality of life without further chemo surgery etc. That is the goal. With stage iv progression is inevitable but this new drug gives me a lot of hope!I was also refereed to a specialized OBGYN who offers \"\"Mona Lisa Touch\"\" laser therapy. This new technology for postmenopausal women works great for young women who suffer some of the nastier side effects from cancer treatment -- aka early onset of menopause that has adverse affects on libido. I plan to blog about this experience very soon as I find not too many people are open to talking about it. The upside is that at 30 I do not have to say goodbye to a healthy sex life. The downside is insurance does not cover it. At all. So friends I am asking once again to please share my story share my gofundme page. A little bit from a handful of folks can go a long way! I am very close to my original goal which has primarily gone toward setting aside a savings account for Frankie and to make up where I am denied life insurance. It would mean the world to have that final push to help me with these new treatment options that can ensure longevity and more importantly quality of life. Many thank and much love!Jen + Read MoreUpdate 8 Posted by Jenny Bassett 31 months ago Share Update time! I recently completed 10 rounds of radiation to my spine. The field was pretty long and as a result I have suffered some irritation to my esophagus making it painful to swallow. It should subside by next week but until then I am basically on a liquid diet. I\\'ve been meaning to try out some new soups and juices anyway though...so it\\'s all good. And it\\'s only temporary.I am anxious for my scans at the end of the month to determine how (if at all) the tumors in my spine responded to radiation as well as how the ongoing hormone therapy is affecting the tumors in my liver. I\\'ve started seeing a counselor...what do I have to be upset about right?! We\\'ve talked a lot about what it means to live a meaningful life; it\\'s something I am working on. I\\'ve come to accept that while I think about death a lot it is not a death wish...it is a life wish. I want to live with purpose and seek fulfillment in all things. I really just want to be content with my life as it is but my counselor challenged me to think bigger and to write up a bucket list. If I could do anything with the time I have left what would I do? Here is what I\\'ve got so far:Take Frankie to Disney Travel to foreign countries-- France Italy Germany India Japan Mexico are some of the ones I\\'ve most wanted to visitGo on an Alaskan cruise and see a whaleLearn a foreign language...I\\'m thinking SpanishSee Tig Notaro liveDance with Ellen on her showMeet Elvis Duran and the Morning ShowThanks to my friend Lisa May I will be going to Rome and Paris this fall! I am beyond excited and had no idea that I\\'d be traveling Europe in my lifetime. It gives me hope that I will be scratching more items off the list one by one! After the trip to Rome/Paris I will be heading to Denver CO for Wellness Weekend sponsored by Living Beyond Breast Cancer. As a young advocate for LBBC I will be participating in their Metastatic Breast Cancer conference track as well as Yoga on the Steps. To sponsor/support my fundraising efforts for LBBC please consider making a donation here: https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=1141084&supId=423748484.Once again thank you all for your love and support!

       " \"Update 13 Posted by Monica Lopez 2 months ago Share 11 It is with the deep sadness I inform you that after a vigorous year and a half battle with stage 4 colon cancer my brother Jean Paul passed away in the afternoon of this past Monday January 1st 2018.My family and I can’t thank you enough for the generous donations warm thoughts and prayers throughout this agonizing ordeal. With your help he was able to obtain some alternative options that helped extend his life till just a few days ago. I am grateful that a huge portion of about twenty family members recently managed to gather down in the Alabama area where we spent JP’s birthday (12/24) and the Christmas holiday together. It was a bittersweet trip as we found JP in deteriorated health conditions. But he still wanted us to partake in a festive environment filled with laughter love music and drink. It also gave us all an opportunity to talk privately with him about how we felt what we thought and reminisce about our childhood. Unfortunately that was the last time I saw my brother alive. As you can imagine it was a difficult and emotional goodbye because we felt that things were nearing the end of his time with us.We can’t say enough about the strength my sister-in-law has displayed since he was diagnosed and especially after his passing. She is a remarkable human being and both Jean Paul and her were fortunate enough to have spent the last 17 years together living a wonderful love filled free spirited life that yielded a beautiful daughter named Serenity.As I make my way down to the Pensacola Florida area where he had lived with his wife daughter and loving in-laws - we find our hearts broken and spirits shattered. But I know that GOD has a higher calling. My faith has taught me that our time here is just a small step in our path a short process. It still doesn’t take away from feeling selfish and wanting my brother to still be by our side. But we know that while he may not physically be here with us today his spirit fills the countless number of people he touched with his love compassion and kindness. He will continue to live forever in our hearts and minds. Heaven has opened their gates to an angel that will always be looking after us. We rejoice in knowing that he is finally reunited with our mother. Together they have both taught us a valuable lesson in life. You must pause in those moments of anger resentfulness sadness and envy of others… to take a look at your surroundings. Absorb all the wonderful things in your life you may inadvertently take for granted. Kiss your significant other children parents siblings and friends longer. Tell them how much they mean to you. Tell them you love them unconditionally. Remember we are only here for a brief moment. Don’t let that time go by without leaving a positive impact on the people that love and care about you.My brother’s final wishes were to have his body cremated. He did not want a wake held. Instead he wanted us to have a “celebration of life” gathering with family and friends. One will be held in the next couple of days here in Pensacola and another one in the NYC area. Details surrounding date time and place are TBD. Once those details are ironed out we will make sure to convey them since we know many of the people whose lives were touched by JP will want to attend.Thanks to all of you who sent us your well wishes made donations and kept us in your prayers. We are so blessed to be surrounded by such amazing people.The remaining donations generated by this incredible campaign will go towards helping Marquise and Serenity move forward in this new and unknown chapter of their lives without Jean Paul by their side. + Read MoreUpdate 12 Posted by Monica Lopez 2 months ago Share It is with the deep sadness I inform you that after a vigorous year and a half battle with stage 4 colon cancer my brother Jean Paul passed away in the afternoon of this past Monday January 1st 2018.My family and I can’t thank you enough for the generous donations warm thoughts and prayers throughout this agonizing ordeal.

We were hoping for no chemo but it\\'s not an option given the rarity and little research they have on this type of cancer. BUT they have a plan. Dad will go next week for the echocardiogram and to have a port put in. The Monday after Thanksgiving he will be admitted into UT Hospital for the week where they will monitor him closely and do 4 straight 8 hour days of a \"\"slow push\"\". They say it is a complicated cocktail and treatment so it will be best for him to be there the whole time rather than coming home in the evenings and traveling back in the mornings. He will do this four times with a 3 week break in between each 4 day rounds. Please pray against any complications and that they will not have to prolong the treatments beyond the 4 months. UT Oncology has been great to fight the VA for Dad so we are not having to do it! They have been a blessing. YOU ALL have been a blessing with all the love and prayer support.
